The magnitude of the question of whether we are alone in the Universe, and the public interest therein, opens the possibility that results may be taken to imply more than the observations support, or than the observers intend. As life-detection objectives become increasingly prominent in space sciences, it is essential to open a community dialogue about how to convey information in a subject matter that is diverse, complicated and has a high potential to be sensationalized. Establishing best practices for communicating about life detection can serve to set reasonable expectations on the early stages of a hugely challenging endeavour, attach value to incremental steps along the path, and build public trust by making clear that false starts and dead ends are an expected and potentially productive part of the scientific process. Here we endeavour to motivate and seed the discussion with basic considerations and offer an example of how such considerations might be incorporated and applied in a proof-of-concept-level framework. Everything mentioned herein, including the name of the confidence scale, is intended not as a prescription, but simply as the beginning of an important dialogue. A framework is proposed to start a dialogue on the criteria for assessing claims and supporting evidence for life beyond Earth.",

		"title": "Dispatched uses Na+ flux to power release of lipid-modified Hedgehog",
		"desc": "The Dispatched protein, which is related to the NPC1 and PTCH1 cholesterol transporters1,2 and to H+-driven transporters of the RND family3,4, enables tissue-patterning activity of the lipid-modified Hedgehog protein by releasing it from tightly -localized sites of embryonic expression5–10. Here we determine a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the mouse protein Dispatched homologue 1 (DISP1), revealing three Na+ ions coordinated within a channel that traverses its transmembrane domain. We find that the rate of Hedgehog export is dependent on the Na+ gradient across the plasma membrane. The transmembrane channel and Na+ binding are disrupted in DISP1-NNN, a variant with asparagine substitutions for three intramembrane aspartate residues that each coordinate and neutralize the charge of one of the three Na+ ions. DISP1-NNN and variants that disrupt single Na+ sites retain binding to, but are impaired in export of the lipid-modified Hedgehog protein to the SCUBE2 acceptor. Interaction of the amino-terminal signalling domain of the Sonic hedgehog protein (ShhN) with DISP1 occurs via an extensive buried surface area and contacts with an extended furin-cleaved DISP1 arm. Variability analysis reveals that ShhN binding is restricted to one extreme of a continuous series of DISP1 conformations. The bound and unbound DISP1 conformations display distinct Na+-site occupancies, which suggests a mechanism by which transmembrane Na+ flux may power extraction of the lipid-linked Hedgehog signal from the membrane. Na+-coordinating residues in DISP1 are conserved in PTCH1 and other metazoan RND family members, suggesting that Na+ flux powers their conformationally driven activities. Cryo-electron microscopy studies show that dynamic coordination of Na+ in the ion channel of Dispatched homologue 1 and the transmembrane Na+ gradient have key roles in exporting lipid-modified Hedgehog protein signal.",

		"title": "AKIRIN2 controls the nuclear import of proteasomes in vertebrates",
		"desc": "Protein expression and turnover are controlled through a complex interplay of transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms to enable spatial and temporal regulation of cellular processes. To systematically elucidate such gene regulatory networks, we developed a CRISPR screening assay based on time-controlled Cas9 mutagenesis, intracellular immunostaining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting that enables the identification of regulatory factors independent of their effects on cellular fitness. We pioneered this approach by systematically probing the regulation of the transcription factor MYC, a master regulator of cell growth1–3. Our screens uncover a highly conserved protein, AKIRIN2, that is essentially required for nuclear protein degradation. We found that AKIRIN2 forms homodimers that directly bind to fully assembled 20S proteasomes to mediate their nuclear import. During mitosis, proteasomes are excluded from condensing chromatin and re-imported into newly formed daughter nuclei in a highly dynamic, AKIRIN2-dependent process. Cells undergoing mitosis in the absence of AKIRIN2 become devoid of nuclear proteasomes, rapidly causing accumulation of MYC and other nuclear proteins. Collectively, our study reveals a dedicated pathway controlling the nuclear import of proteasomes in vertebrates and establishes a scalable approach to decipher regulators in essential cellular processes. Using time-controlled CRISPR screens, the authors identify AKIRIN2 as a factor involved in the nuclear import of the proteasome.",

		"desc": "Glutathione (GSH) is a small-molecule thiol that is abundant in all eukaryotes and has key roles in oxidative metabolism1. Mitochondria, as the major site of oxidative reactions, must maintain sufficient levels of GSH to perform protective and biosynthetic functions2. GSH is synthesized exclusively in the cytosol, yet the molecular machinery involved in mitochondrial GSH import remains unknown. Here, using organellar proteomics and metabolomics approaches, we identify SLC25A39, a mitochondrial membrane carrier of unknown function, as a regulator of GSH transport into mitochondria. Loss of SLC25A39 reduces mitochondrial GSH import and abundance without affecting cellular GSH levels. Cells lacking both SLC25A39 and its paralogue SLC25A40 exhibit defects in the activity and stability of proteins containing iron–sulfur clusters. We find that mitochondrial GSH import is necessary for cell proliferation in vitro and red blood cell development in mice. Heterologous expression of an engineered bifunctional bacterial GSH biosynthetic enzyme (GshF) in mitochondria enables mitochondrial GSH production and ameliorates the metabolic and proliferative defects caused by its depletion. Finally, GSH availability negatively regulates SLC25A39 protein abundance, coupling redox homeostasis to mitochondrial GSH import in mammalian cells. Our work identifies SLC25A39 as an essential and regulated component of the mitochondrial GSH-import machinery. SLC25A39 and its paralogue SLC25A40 have redundant roles in the import of glutathione into mitochondria of mammalian cells.",

Of the two main objects of a University in any English sense of the expression—the promotion of the higher education, and the advancement of learning—both must be equally subserved; and neither will be attained if the new University be established on other than the broadest possible basis, or if its development be controlled and hindered by rivalries that could not but become of an ignoble character. In the course of discussion it has been made abundantly clear that a duplication of Universities in London would be a misfortune of the first magnitude, dividing resources and diverting energies into channels that would lead to many undesirable results. It is equally clear that a University, consisting of a federation of local educational institutions existing within the same narrow area, would be wanting both in unity and force: its government would tend to become a succession of compromises effected between the interests, almost wholly of a financial nature, of its constituent Colleges. It may, then, be taken as a conclusion accepted by the great majority of those who have given special attention to the subject that there should be one University, and one only, in London, and that it should not be of a federal character. To this position it is a simple corollary that the government of the proposed University should be vested mainly in a professorial body. Much the most important work of the University would be the enactment of curricula and syllabuses and the control of teaching and examination—work that can only be efficiently performed by those specially familiar with the subjects taught. With the Professors a proper number of Crown nominees should be associated to act as moderators and as representatives of general educational policy, as well as to guard the interests and assure the continued confidence of the public. With the mode of creation and with the functions of the usual Faculties, and with the details of examinational systems, we need not at present concern ourselves. In fact, the less the new University is fettered by any Charter or Act the better, and it would be a misfortune were the precedent followed of the complicated and minutely detailed Charter recently rejected by the Convocation of the London University. On that occasion, it must be admitted, Convocation made good use of its veto, but its continued possession of such a power would, we think, be a source of disquiet and danger, without any corresponding advantage to Convocation itself, or the University—especially a professorial University—or indeed to the public. A much more useful provision would be the grant of a power of appeal to some such Committee of the Privy Council as that by whose aid the Scotch Universities are enabled to settle their differences.",

We have employed the same method to examine the effect of the bombardment of a layer of lithium by a stream of these ions, the lithium being placed inside the tube at 45° to the beam. A mica window of stopping power of 2 cm. of air was sealed on to the side of the tube, and the existence of radiation from the lithium was investigated by the scintillation method outside the tube. The thickness of the mica window was much more than sufficient to prevent any scattered protons from escaping into the air even at the highest voltages used. 1932 saw the announcement of the first apparatus for artificially accelerating atomic particles to high energies: the Cockcroft-Walton accelerator. And, barely a month later, beams of high-energy protons produced by this machine were used to initiate the disintegration of lithium nuclei, and thereby confirm the equivalence of mass and energy.",

		"desc": "RECENT experiments1,2 have revealed the existence of a new kind of nuclear reaction: neutron bombardment of uranium and thorium loads to an explosion of the nucleus, which splits up into particles of inferior charge and weight, a considerable amount of energy being liberated in this process. Assuming a partition into two particles only, so that the nuclear mass and charge of uranium have to be distributed between two lighter nuclei, the latter contain considerably more neutrons than the heaviest stable isotopes with the same nuclear charges. (A splitting into, for example, 98Rb and 141Cs means an excess of 11 neutrons in the first, and of 8 neutrons in the second of these two nuclei.) There seem to be two possibilities, of getting rid of this neutron excess. By the emission of a α′-ray, a neutron is transformed into a proton, thus reducing the neutron excess by two units; in the example given above, five and four successive α′-activities respectively would be needed to restore the neutron-proton stability ratio. In fact, the explosion products have been observed to be α-active and several periods have been recorded, so that a part, at least, of the neutron excess is certainly disposed of in this way. Another possible process is the direct liberation of neutrons, taking place either as a part of the explosion itself, or as an “evaporation” from the resulting nuclei which would be formed in an excited state.",

		"desc": "Large depletions in stratospheric ozone were first reported by Farman et al.1 at Halley Bay (76°S), and confirmed by satellite observations2. Chubachi3 gives a detailed account of ozone decreases and temperatures in the lower stratosphere during the spring of 1982 at 69°S. There is now evidence2 for annual declines in total ozone by ∼6 and 3% in regions of total ozone minima and maxima, respectively, from September to mid-October since the late 1970s. We propose here a chemical mechanism for the formation of the ozone hole. It involves removal of gaseous odd nitrogen by ion- and/or aerosol-catalysed conversion of N2O5 and ClONO2 to HNO3 vapour, followed by heteromolecular HNO3–H2O condensation, leading to HNO3–H2O aerosols. At an altitude of 17km, these processes start at temperatures below 205±5 K, well above the condensation temperature of pure water vapour. We propose that the absence of gaseous odd nitrogen and catalytic methane oxidation reactions driven by sunlight in early spring lead to large OH concentrations which rapidly convert HCl to ClOX. Catalytic reactions of ClOX and BrOX cause drastic ozone destructions and can account for the springtime ‘ozone hole’ first observed by Farman et al.1. By our model the depletion would be mainly due to emissions of industrial organic chlorine compounds. Arctic regions may also become affected. The depletion lasts while HNO3, but not HCl, is incorporated in the particles in the temperature range 205±5 K to 192 K.",

Geospatial data describing the energy system are required to manage generation intermittency, mitigate climate change risks, and identify trade-offs with biodiversity, conservation and land protection priorities caused by the land-use and land-cover change necessary for PV deployment. Currently available inventories of solar generating capacity cannot fully address these needs1–9. Here we provide a global inventory of commercial-, industrial- and utility-scale PV installations (that is, PV generating stations in excess of 10 kilowatts nameplate capacity) by using a longitudinal corpus of remote sensing imagery, machine learning and a large cloud computation infrastructure. We locate and verify 68,661 facilities, an increase of 432 per cent (in number of facilities) on previously available asset-level data. With the help of a hand-labelled test set, we estimate global installed generating capacity to be 423 gigawatts (−75/+77 gigawatts) at the end of 2018. Enrichment of our dataset with estimates of facility installation date, historic land-cover classification and proximity to vulnerable areas allows us to show that most of the PV solar energy facilities are sited on cropland, followed by aridlands and grassland. Our inventory could aid PV delivery aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals.

Mosaics of photomicrographs of three of these events are given in Figs. 1, 2 and 3. The edges of the individual photographs have not been trimmed so that the components of the mosaics can be distinguished. Three grains of a track in Fig. 1, indicated by three arrows, which were out of focus in the original negatives, have been blackened with ink, but the photographs are otherwise completely unretouched. 1947 was the year of the pion - flick through Nature volumes 159 and 160 and watch the story unfold. In February of that year, Cecil Powell and Giuseppe Occhialini reported the observation of six star-like patterns in emulsions exposed to cosmic rays. Powell’s group had finally found the Yukawa particle, predicted in 1935 to be the carrier of strong force inside the atomic nucleus. In fact, Don Perkins pipped them to the post with the publication of a single, similar star-like event just two weeks earlier [Perkins, D. H. Nature 159, 126–127 (1947)]. Later in the year, another paper from Powell’s group announced the first observation of pion decay to a muon - the particle picture was beginning to take shape.",

		"desc": "AN image of an object may be defined as a graphical representation of the spatial distribution of one or more of its properties. Image formation usually requires that the object interact with a matter or radiation field characterized by a wavelength comparable to or smaller than the smallest features to be distinguished, so that the region of interaction may be restricted and a resolved image generated. In 1973, Paul Lauterbur described an imaging technique that removed the usual resolution limits due to the wavelength of the imaging field. He used two fields: one interacting with the object under investigation, the other restricting this interaction to a small region. Rotation of the fields relative to the object produces a series of one-dimensional projections of the interacting regions, from which two- or three-dimensional images of their spatial distribution can be reconstructed. Application of this technique as magnetic resonance imaging is now widespread.",

More ominously, the existence of neutron-induced radioactivity also suggested the possibility of neutron chain-reactions - using the neutrons emitted by radioactive elements to induce radioactivity, and liberate further neutrons, from other nuclei.

Much of this diversity remains unexplained, although diet, environment, host genetics and early microbial exposure have all been implicated. Accordingly, to characterize the ecology of human-associated microbial communities, the Human Microbiome Project has analysed the largest cohort and set of distinct, clinically relevant body habitats so far. We found the diversity and abundance of each habitat’s signature microbes to vary widely even among healthy subjects, with strong niche specialization both within and among individuals. The project encountered an estimated 81–99% of the genera, enzyme families and community configurations occupied by the healthy Western microbiome. Metagenomic carriage of metabolic pathways was stable among individuals despite variation in community structure, and ethnic/racial background proved to be one of the strongest associations of both pathways and microbes with clinical metadata. These results thus delineate the range of structural and functional configurations normal in the microbial communities of a healthy population, enabling future characterization of the epidemiology, ecology and translational applications of the human microbiome. The Human Microbiome Project Consortium reports the first results of their analysis of microbial communities from distinct, clinically relevant body habitats in a human cohort; the insights into the microbial communities of a healthy population lay foundations for future exploration of the epidemiology, ecology and translational applications of the human microbiome. The Human Microbiome Project (HMP), supported by the National Institutes of Health Common Fund, has the goal of characterizing the microbial communities that inhabit and interact with the human body in sickness and in health. In two Articles in this issue of Nature, the HMP Consortium presents the first population-scale details of the organismal and functional composition of the microbiota across five areas of the body. An associated News & Views discusses the initial results — which, along with those of a series of co-publications, already constitute the most extensive catalogue of organisms and genes related to the human microbiome yet published — and highlights some of the major questions that the project will tackle in the next few years.",

War has now become so terrible, so swift in its march and so indisc iminate in its cutting off of old and young alike, that the greater nations of the world must recoil with horror from the possibility of another major war, lest they court annihilation of whole populations. This is not to say that armed forces will be unnecessary; for so long as man fails short of the ideal in his ethical outlook and practice, there will be differences and disputes, some of which may lead to wars. But it should not be beyond the power of the nations, imperfect as man is, to limit the conflict and promote a swift settlement.

The first all-electronic scheme for television was outlined by A. A. Campbell Swinton in 1908. Campbell Swinton imagined a receiving apparatus comprising an electron beam, deflected by electromagnets, scanning across a \"sensitive fluorescent screen\". He suggested that the camera might also incorporate a scanning electron beam, but anticipated that a new photoelectric phenomenon would need to be discovered, to make such a camera a reality.",

		"desc": "During experiments aimed at understanding the mechanisms by which long-chain carbon molecules are formed in interstellar space and circumstellar shells1, graphite has been vaporized by laser irradiation, producing a remarkably stable cluster consisting of 60 carbon atoms. Concerning the question of what kind of 60-carbon atom structure might give rise to a superstable species, we suggest a truncated icosahedron, a polygon with 60 vertices and 32 faces, 12 of which are pentagonal and 20 hexagonal. This object is commonly encountered as the football shown in Fig. 1. The C60 molecule which results when a carbon atom is placed at each vertex of this structure has all valences satisfied by two single bonds and one double bond, has many resonance structures, and appears to be aromatic. Before 1985, it was generally accepted that elemental carbon exists in two forms, or allotropes: diamond and graphite. Then, Kroto et al. identified the signature of a new, stable form of carbon that consisted of clusters of 60 atoms. They called this third allotrope of carbon 'buckminsterfullerene', and proposed that it consisted of polyhedral molecules in which the atoms were arrayed at the vertices of a truncated icosahedron. In 1990, the synthesis of large quantities of C60 [see Nature 347, 354–358 (1990)] confirmed this hypothesis.",

But, on the whole, the disputants made at least an attempt in public to discuss the matter in its bearings on the child, the teacher, and the parent. The overburdened parent, the pauperizing effect of partial remission, the child kept from school because of his parents poverty, the teachers converted into tax-collectors—these were the stage properties of the one party; while the stock-in-trade of the other side included the sacred necessity of guarding “parental responsibility,” and the assertion that no one values what he does not pay for, and that to tax the hard-earned savings of the respectable middle-class to free the education of the children of the worthless and unthrifty was a Socialistic proposal of the crudest kind.",

Sir William visited the United States during the spring, and on April 24, in the course of the annual meeting at Washington of the National Academy of Sciences, delivered the second Pilgrim Trust Lecture, which appears on p. 21 of this issue of NATURE. The effect of science upon social conditions formed the theme of Sir William's address, which he illustrated by dipping into the history of the Royal Society Starting as a body of ‘virtuosi’ who met for discussion and experiment about the middle of the seventeenth century, the Royal Society early became concerned in problems of interest to a wider circle and to the State. Inquiries submitted to correspondents, their reports, and papers read before the Society, illustrate the effects of science upon society and conversely, of the circumstances of the times upon scientific investigations. Sir William leads up to an eloquent plea for the earnest consideration of current affairs in the spirit of science, which links up with the efforts of the Division for Social and International Relations of Science of the British Association; the Manchester meeting of the latter referred to on p. 1 of this issue deals specifically with some social aspects of scientific research, while Sir William points the moral on the wider issue.",

A photograph so obtained is reproduced (Fig. 1). If the density of the plate is measured by a photometer at a number of points along a radius, and the intensity of the rays at these points found by using the characteristic blackening curve of the plate (see Phil. Mag., vol. 1, p. 963, 1926), the rings appear as humps on the intensity-distance curves. In this way rings can be detected which may not be obvious to direct inspection. With rays of about 13,000 volts two rings have been found inside the obvious one. Traces have been found of a fourth ring in other photographs, but not more than three have been found on any one exposure.

Prof. Nordenskjöld's feat is one of the finest instances of scientific prediction based on ascertained data that we know of, and we would recommend it to Sir William Harcourt's consideration when he contemplates taking part in another political “agitation.” Sir William has succeeded in getting such a firm grasp of the real nature of scientific method, and he applied it so wittily and so well in his recent Birmingham address that we would advise him to follow out this line in real earnest. So thoroughly does he seem to understand the method of scientific research and scientific prediction, and so ably, although only in sport and to banter his opponents, did he expound it, that we think science has lost in him a successful worker. To this loss we could resign ourselves if Sir William would set himself to rescue politics from its present degraded position as a mere theatre for party strife, and to elevate it into something like a science of national life and progress.

The observed ozone content at Halley Bay was ∼30% lower in the Antarctic spring seasons (October) of 1980–84 than in the springs of 1957–73. No such obvious perturbation is observable in other seasons, or at other than the very highest latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere, and the magnitude of the observed change there far exceeds climatological variability2. We present here balloonsonde ozone data3,4 which show that these ozone changes are largely confined to the region from about 10 to 20 km, during the period August to October. We show that homogeneous (gas phase) chemistry as presently understood cannot explain these observed depletions. On the other hand, a unique feature of the Antarctic lower stratosphere is its high frequency of polar stratospheric clouds5, providing a reaction site for heterogeneous reactions. A heterogeneous reaction between HCl and ClONO2 is explored as a possible mechanism to explain the ozone observations. This process produces changes in ozone that are consistent with the observations, and its implications for the behaviour of HNO3 and NO2 in the Antarctic stratosphere are consistent with observations of those species there, providing an important check on the proposed mechanism. Similar ozone changes are obtained with another possible heterogeneous reaction, H2O + ClONO2.",

If this were the main result of the reiteration of the principle that scientific inquiry can only develop to its full extent in an atmosphere of political freedom, it might reasonably be suggested that there has been too much talk about liberty but too little done to secure it. Fifty years ago, as Prof. Hogben reminded us in his Conway Memorial Lecture— “The Retreat from Reason”—T. H. Huxley, in an address on technical education, used the pregnant words “The great end of life is not knowledge but action” ; and this principle may be applied very appropriately to the reaction that has resulted from a knowledge of conditions deliberately created to restrict scientific work to particular classes, and thus to destroy the international character of the pursuit of scientific truth.",

Both species are characterized by greater brain size, increased body height and smaller teeth relative to Pliocene Australopithecus in Africa. Here we report the discovery, from the Late Pleistocene of Flores, Indonesia, of an adult hominin with stature and endocranial volume approximating 1 m and 380 cm3, respectively—equal to the smallest-known australopithecines. The combination of primitive and derived features assigns this hominin to a new species, Homo floresiensis. The most likely explanation for its existence on Flores is long-term isolation, with subsequent endemic dwarfing, of an ancestral H. erectus population. Importantly, H. floresiensis shows that the genus Homo is morphologically more varied and flexible in its adaptive responses than previously thought.",

Comparative genomics suggest that this mtDNA derives from an out-of-Africa migration distinct from those that gave rise to Neanderthals and modern humans. The stratigraphy of the Denisova Cave where the bone — part of the fifth 'little finger' digit — was excavated in 2008, suggests that this hominin lived close geographically to Neanderthals and modern humans, and at the same time. Taken with the presence of Homo floresiensis in Indonesia about 17,000 years ago, this discovery suggests that multiple late Pleistocene hominin lineages coexisted for long periods of time in Eurasia. Ancient mitochondrial DNA from a hominin individual who lived in the mountains of Central Asia between 48,000–30,000 years ago has been sequenced. Comparative genomics suggest that this mitochondrial DNA derives from an out-of-Africa migration distinct from the ones that gave rise to Neanderthals and modern humans. It also seems that this hominin lived in close spatio-temporal proximity to Neanderthals and modern humans. With the exception of Neanderthals, from which DNA sequences of numerous individuals have now been determined1, the number and genetic relationships of other hominin lineages are largely unknown. Here we report a complete mitochondrial (mt) DNA sequence retrieved from a bone excavated in 2008 in Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains in southern Siberia. It represents a hitherto unknown type of hominin mtDNA that shares a common ancestor with anatomically modern human and Neanderthal mtDNAs about 1.0 million years ago. This indicates that it derives from a hominin migration out of Africa distinct from that of the ancestors of Neanderthals and of modern humans. The stratigraphy of the cave where the bone was found suggests that the Denisova hominin lived close in time and space with Neanderthals as well as with modern humans2,3,4.",

For some purposes, however, it is possible to use as a shearing interferometer an even simpler system which is already in wide use for another purpose. This is the square prism used in photometry for dividing a beam of light into two. It is composed of two similar right-angled prisms cemented at their hypotenuse faces after one face has been coated with a semi-reflecting film. An application of this prism to the interferometry of length was first described by Kösters4, but the prism is also very useful as a shearing interferometer.",

Walter Schottky first postulated the existence of thermal noise and shot noise in 1918. In a letter to Nature in 1927, J. B. Johnson commented on voltage fluctuations that appear \"to be the result of thermal agitation of the electric charges in the material of the conductor\". Johnson would later become associated with thermal noise — now also known as Johnson noise — after he published a definitive experiment on noise in 1928, alongside Harry Nyquist's theoretical explanation [Johnson, J. B. Phys. Rev. 32, 97–109 (1928); Nyquist, H. Phys. Rev. 32, 110–113 (1928)]. But his letter of 1927 was intended to bring \"a similar phenomenon\" to the attention of Nature readers.

Radioactive particles up to ∼1 μm in diameter have been collected and analysed by electron microscopy; their form and composition lead to an estimate of ∼2,500°C for the temperature in at least part of the reactor core. The level of radioactivity in air has decreased from initial values of a few becquerels (disintegrations per s) per m3, to very low values, and the activity level on grass is also decreasing due to decay and weathering. The radiation doses due to the fallout will be small compared with those from natural sources (such as radon emission in buildings), and will not cause significant health effects.",

		"desc": "CONJUGATED polymers are organic semiconductors, the semiconducting behaviour being associated with the π molecular orbitals delocalized along the polymer chain. Their main advantage over non-polymeric organic semiconductors is the possibility of processing the polymer to form useful and robust structures. The response of the system to electronic excitation is nonlinear—the injection of an electron and a hole on the conjugated chain can lead to a self-localized excited state which can then decay radiatively, suggesting the possibility of using these materials in electroluminescent devices. We demonstrate here that poly(p-phenylene vinylene), prepared by way of a solution-processable precursor, can be used as the active element in a large-area light-emitting diode. The combination of good structural properties of this polymer, its ease of fabrication, and light emission in the green–yellow part of the spectrum with reasonably high efficiency, suggest that the polymer can be used for the development of large-area light-emitting displays. By 1990, the development of solid-state light-emitting diodes (LEDs) had come a long way. Efficient LEDs based on inorganic semiconductors had already found widespread application. Molecular organic semiconductors were also coming to the fore - not only were they available in a range of colours but, unlike their inorganic counterparts, they could be readily made into flexible, large-area displays. But physicists were encountering problems with the long-term stability of the organic films. Then Jeremy Burroughes and colleagues produced the first polymer LED: moving from molecular to macromolecular materials solved the stability problem and meant that high-quality films could be made easily.\n",

Since a nuclear particle must be held in the nucleus by an attractive field, we must, in order to explain its ejection, arrange for a spontaneous change from an attractive to a repulsive field. It has hitherto been necessary to postulate some special arbitrary ‘instability’ of the nucleus; but in the following note it is pointed out that disintegration is a natural consequence of the laws of quantum mechanics without any special hypothesis. The half-lives of α-emitters span an enormous range — from less than a microsecond to more than 1015 years — although the emitted α-particles vary in energy by less than an order of magnitude. This extreme sensitivity of the escape probability to the particle's energy was explained in 1928 by Gurney and Condon (and, independently, by George Gamow [Gamow, G. Z. Phys. 51, 204–212 (1928)]) by invoking the recently discovered phenomenon of quantum-mechanical barrier penetration, or tunnelling. Until this time, α-decay had been envisaged as a violent process; by contrast, Gurney and Condon suggested that the tunnelling α-particle \"slips away almost unnoticed\".",

The Anglo-Saxon spirit is essentially one which makes for fair-dealing; the race has never been a race of oppressors. Equity, truth, and justice have been our watch-words; and on the whole the nation has acted up to its convictions. It is this national feeling which has led to our taking part in the present war; rather than see a treaty broken, rather than allow a small nation to be coerced into an immoral act by a large and powerful one, we have lent our aid to the French and the Russians, and we are all prepared to support to the death what we all believe to be a righteous cause.",

The successive expulsion of one  and two  particles in three radio-active changes in any order brings the intra-atomic charge of the element back to its initial value, and the element back to its original place in the table, though its atomic mass is reduced by four units. We have recently obtained something like a direct proof of van der Broek’s view that the intra-atomic charge of the nucleus of an atom is not a purely positive charge, as on Rutherford’s tentative theory, but is the difference between a positive and a smaller negative charge. In 1913, only the barest outlines of the structure of the atom had been drawn. Frederick Soddy, although struggling to understand how an electron could be emitted from the nucleus during beta-decay, supported the conclusions of A. van de Broeck - that an element's atomic number, not its atomic weight, is the fundamental parameter determining chemical properties. Soddy introduced the word 'isotope' for elements that occupy the same place in the periodic table and hence have identical properties, though different mass. He also contested \"Rutherford's tentative theory\" that the nucleus has only positive charge. One week later, a rather indignant Ernest Rutherford responded: the nucleus has \"resultant\" positive charge, he said, and as he elaborated, Rutherford came tantalizingly close to postulating the proton.\n",

		"desc": "A PARLIAMENTARY paper issued at the close of last session gives some information on what is intended to be done in the matter of the great approaching astronomical events of 1874 and 1882, which will interest many readers of NATURE. The correspondence on this subject between the Astronomer Royal and the Hydrographer of the Admiralty, and between the Hydrographer and the Secretary to the Admiralty, is given at full length, and together with the appended remarks of Captain Toynbee, Admiral Ommaney, Commander Davis, Mr. Stone, and Mr. Warren Dela Rue, well merits careful perusal. On the whole it seems to be at least doubtful whether the requisite Antarctic station for the observation of the transit, which in the opinion of the Astronomer Royal should, if possible, be in the neighbourhood of Mounts Erebus and Terror, can be attained, or if, when attained, it is likely to be possible to make observations from it. But this Antarctic station is only required for the transit of 1882, and there is ample time to make a preparatory; Antarctic expedition to ascertain the doubtful point. In the meantime, however, let us see what has been; settled about the transit of 1874. For the proper observation of this event the Astronomer Royal informs us that it will be necessary, after making allowance for all the aid that may be expected from foreign and colonial; observatories, to organise expeditions to the following five stations:—(1) Oahu (Sandwich Islands), (2) Kerguelen's Island, (3) Rodriguez, (4) Auckland (New Zealand), (5) Alexandria. At the first three of these stations—namely Oahu, Kerguelen's Island, and Rodriguez—it will be necessary to make preparatory observations for twelve months, in order to ascertain the absolute longitudes of these places, which are not exactly known. The total cost of these proposed observing expeditions for the transit of 1874 is estimated by the Hydrographer at 10,404l., a sum which, it must be admitted, is moderate for work of such surpassing importance, and, as the Lords of the Treasury state that they have “no objection to offer”to the proposed expenditure, we may take it for granted it will be so far carried out. But what I wish to call attention to at the present moment is the valuable opportunity thus offered for still further augmenting the importance of this event to the progress of science generally, by converting these proposed astronomical expeditions into expeditions for general scientific observation. At three of the spots to be visited it will be necessary to keep up an observing party, more or less extensive, for upwards of twelve months. Now, it so happens that the three spots thus selected for astronomical observatories are also of very great interest for biological studies. The Sandwich Islands are well known to be the seat of a most peculiar indigenous flora and fauna, which has been hitherto very incompletely explored, rivalling perhaps even that of the Galapagos in eccentricity. They are likewise the seat of some of the most stupendous volcanic phenomena known on the globe. Who can doubt that one or more zoologists, botanists, and geologists would find ample work during a twelvemonth's sojourn in these islands, and would reap a rich harvest of results? The little island of Rodriguez was formerly the residence of a bird allied to the Dodo, and probably of other extinct forms o life. Professor Newton and his brother have, it is true, already made us tolerably well acquainted with the osteology of Pezophaps, as this gigantic ground-pigeon is termed. But there is no doubt that a careful exploration of the bone-caves of Rodriguez will lead to still further discoveries as regards Pezophaps, and most probably result in bringing to light other unknown extinct inhabitants of the submerged continent, which was the ancient focus of Didine life. Kerguelen's Island, the third point selected for a temporary astronomical observatory, is also in many points worthy of renewed investigation. Although we may probably believDr. Hooker, who visited it during Sir James Ross's Antarctic Expedition, left but few plants for future botanists to discover, the seals and whales that frequent its shores, together with the sea-fowl and other inhabitants of the coast, would well occupy the attention of zoologists. It is, moreover, of especial importance that the “abundant fossil remains” of its now extinct forests should be thoroughly investigated, in order to obtain more knowledge of the former distribution of land and water in the South Pacific. I have mentioned only some of the principal and most noticeable points for biological inquiry in each of these three localities. But, as every naturalist knows, in the case of such isolated land-areas as these marine islands, it is of especial importance to the progress of our knowledge of general geographical distribution to have a complete account of every branch of their faunas and floras, both recent and extinct. I beg leave, therefore, to urge upon all who are interested in the progress of science, the importance of not losing the opportunity that now presents itself. The additional expense of attaching two or three qualified Natural History observers (or at any rate collectors) to these three expeditions could not be very great. The numerous American and Russian exploring expeditions are invariably accompanied by zoological and botanical collectors, nor is the money required to publish the results obtained by them grudged by the Governments of these countries. Even poverty-stricken Austria did not send the Novara round the world without a competent corps of naturalists, and we are now reaping the fruits of the abundant harvest which they gathered in. Far from lagging behind, wealthy England ought to take the lead in such cases, and instead of its being necessary, when an opportunity of the sort occurs, to take all kinds of extraordinary steps in order to induce the Government to.take advantage of it, such things should be done as matters of course.",

Values in 1985 were even lower, comparable with the lowest values recorded anywhere on Earth2. We suggest here that the loss of O3 in Antarctica may be attributed to catalysis of O3 recombination by a scheme in which the rate-limiting step is defined by the reaction ClO+BrO→Cl+Br+O2. Concentrations of NO2 must be low and heterogenous reactions involving particles in the polar stratospheric clouds must be an important element of the relevant chemistry. Industrial sources make important contributions to the contemporary budgets of both BrO and ClO and are likely to grow significantly in the future.",

Joliot found, when measuring the ionisation produced by this beryllium radiation in a vessel with a thin window, that the ionisation increased when matter containing hydrogen was placed in front of the window. The effect appeared to be due to the ejection of protons with velocities up to a maximum of nearly 3 × 109 cm. per sec. They suggested that the transference of energy to the proton was by a process similar to the Compton effect, and estimated that the beryllium radiation had a quantum energy of 50 × 106 electron volts. A new form of penetrating radiation came to light in 1930, when Bothe and others bombarded beryllium with ?-particles. Although these emissions were attributed initially to an unusual form of gamma radiation, James Chadwick suspected a different origin. In 1932, he showed that the physical properties of the radiation could be explained by invoking a neutral particle of one atomic mass unit: the neutron (and modern nuclear physics) was born.",

The instrument which embodies the solution of this principle he has named the Photophone. It bears the same relation to the telephone as the heliograph bears to the telegraph. You speak to a transmitting instrument, which flashes the vibrations along a beam of light to a distant station, where a receiving instrument reconverts the light into audible speech. As in the case of that exquisite instrument, the telephone, so in the case of the photophone, the means to accomplish this end are of the most ridiculous simplicity. The transmitter consists of a plane silvered mirror of thin glass or mica. Against the back of this flexible mirror the speaker's voice is directed; a powerful beam of light is caught by a lens from the sun and directed upon the mirror, so as to be reflected straight to the distant station. This beam of light is thrown by the speaker's voice into corresponding vibrations. At the distant station the beam is received by another mirror, and concentrated upon a simple disk of hard rubber fixed as a diaphragm across the end of a hearing-tube. The intermittent rays throw the disk into vibration in a way not yet explained, yet with sufficient power to produce an audible result, thus reproducing the very tones of the speaker. Other receivers may be used, in which the variation in electrical resistance of selenium under varying illumination is the essential principle. The experimental details have been worked out by Prof. Bell in conjunction with Mr. Sumner Tainter. They have discovered that other substances beside hard rubber, gold, selenium, silver, iron, paper, and notably antimony, are similarly sensitive to light. This singular production of mechanical vibrations by rays of light is even more mysterious than the production of vibrations in iron and steel by changes of magnetisation. It was indeed this latter fact which led the discoverers to suspect the analogous phenomenon of photophonic sensibility in selenium and in other substances. Hitherto, in consequence of the mere optical difficulties of managing the beam of light, the distance to which sounds have been actually transmitted by the Photophone is less than a quarter of a mile, but there is no reason to doubt that the method can be applied to much greater distances, and that sounds can be transmitted from one station to another wherever a beam of light can be flashed; hence we may expect the slow spelling, out of words in the flashing signals of the heliograph to be superseded by the more expeditious whispers of the Photophone.",

		"desc": "THERE is now abundant evidence for the presence of large quantities of unseen matter surrounding normal galaxies, including our own1,2. The nature of this ’dark matter‘ is unknown, except that it cannot be made of normal stars, dust or gas, as they would be easily detected. Exotic particles such as axions, massive neutrinos or other weakly interacting massive particles (collectively known as WIMPs) have been proposed3,4, but have yet to be detected. A less exotic alternative is normal matter in the form of bodies with masses ranging from that of a large planet to a few solar masses. Such objects, known collectively as massive compact halo objects5 (MACHOs), might be brown dwarfs or ‘jupiters’ (bodies too small to produce their own energy by fusion), neutron stars, old white dwarfs or black holes. Paczynski6 suggested that MACHOs might act as gravitational microlenses, temporarily amplifying the apparent brightness of background stars in nearby galaxies. We are conducting a microlensing experiment to determine whether the dark matter halo of our Galaxy is made up of MACHOs. Here we report a candidate for such a microlensing event, detected by monitoring the light curves of 1.8 million stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud for one year. The light curve shows no variation for most of the year of data taking, and an upward excursion lasting over 1 month, with a maximum increase of ∼2 mag. The most probable lens mass, inferred from the duration of the candidate lensing event, is ∼0.1 solar mass. In 1986, Bohdan Paczynski suggested that dark, compact objects in the halo of our Galaxy — the local cousins of similar objects conjectured to contribute dark matter to the haloes of other galaxies — could be detected on Earth, as their gravitation might occasionally amplify the light arriving from more distant stars. In 1993, in surveys of several million stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, C. Alcock et al. and E. Aubourg et al. observed several candidate events. In total, the two groups detected three stars for which the brightness increased by two magnitudes over an interval of roughly one month. ",

Results from such models are often accepted by default as global estimates3. The inadequacy of this approach is here made evident by observations that the spring values of total O3 in Antarctica have now fallen considerably. The circulation in the lower stratosphere is apparently unchanged, and possible chemical causes must be considered. We suggest that the very low temperatures which prevail from midwinter until several weeks after the spring equinox make the Antarctic stratosphere uniquely sensitive to growth of inorganic chlorine, ClX, primarily by the effect of this growth on the NO2/NO ratio. This, with the height distribution of UV irradiation peculiar to the polar stratosphere, could account for the O3 losses observed.",

Following up this work, we have attempted to liberate neutrons from beryllium by means of hard X-rays, produced by high-voltage electron tubes. An electron tube, which could conveniently be operated by a high-voltage impulse generator at several million volts2, is at present in use in the High Tension Laboratory of the A.E.G. in Berlin, and has served in the present experiment for the production of X-rays. In September 1934, Leo Szilard and T. H. Chalmers let gamma rays fall onto a beryllium target, noting that emissions from the target induced radioactivity in iodine. \"We conclude,\" they wrote, \"that neutrons are liberated from beryllium by gamma rays.\" Two months later, A. Brasch and colleagues, including Szilard and Chalmers, reported a similar effect using X-rays rather than gamma rays. More ominously, the existence of neutron-induced radioactivity also suggested the possibility of neutron chain-reactions — using the neutrons emitted by radioactive elements to induce radioactivity, and liberate further neutrons, from other nuclei. The first demonstration came four years later, following the discovery of nuclear fission in uranium [see Nature 143, 239-240 (1939)].",

The experimental arrangement is such that the intensity of scattering can be measured in any latitude from the equator (plane of the target) to within 20° of the pole (incident beam) and in any azimuth. In 1927, Davisson and Germer bombarded a single crystal of nickel with a beam of electrons, and observed several beams of scattered electrons that were almost as well defined as the incident beam. The phenomenological similarities with X-ray diffraction were striking, and showed that a wavelength could indeed be associated with the electrons.",

At a distance of 1.8 parsecs1, it is the closest single star to the Sun; only the three stars in the α Centauri system are closer. Barnard’s star is also among the least magnetically active red dwarfs known2,3 and has an estimated age older than the Solar System. Its properties make it a prime target for planetary searches; various techniques with different sensitivity limits have been used previously, including radial-velocity imaging4–6, astrometry7,8 and direct imaging9, but all ultimately led to negative or null results. Here we combine numerous measurements from high-precision radial-velocity instruments, revealing the presence of a low-amplitude periodic signal with a period of 233 days. Independent photometric and spectroscopic monitoring, as well as an analysis of instrumental systematic effects, suggest that this signal is best explained as arising from a planetary companion. The candidate planet around Barnard’s star is a cold super-Earth, with a minimum mass of 3.2 times that of Earth, orbiting near its snow line (the minimum distance from the star at which volatile compounds could condense). The combination of all radial-velocity datasets spanning 20 years of measurements additionally reveals a long-term modulation that could arise from a stellar magnetic-activity cycle or from a more distant planetary object. Because of its proximity to the Sun, the candidate planet has a maximum angular separation of 220 milliarcseconds from Barnard’s star, making it an excellent target for direct imaging and astrometric observations in the future. Analysis of 20 years of observations of Barnard’s star from seven facilities reveals a signal with a period of 233 days that is indicative of a companion planet.",

Using the 305-m Arecibo radiotelescope to make precise timing measurements of pulses from the recently discovered 6.2-ms pulsar PSR1257 +12 (ref. 2), we demonstrate that, rather than being associated with a stellar object, the pulsar is orbited by two or more planet-sized bodies. The planets detected so far have masses of at least 2.8 M⊕ and 3.4 M⊕ where M⊕ is the mass of the Earth. Their respective distances from the pulsar are 0.47 AU and 0.36 AU, and they move in almost circular orbits with periods of 98.2 and 66.6 days. Observations indicate that at least one more planet may be present in this system. The detection of a planetary system around a nearby (∼500 pc), old neutron star, together with the recent report on a planetary companion to the pulsar PSR1829–10 (ref. 3) raises the tantalizing possibility that a non-negligible fraction of neutron stars observable as radio pulsars may be orbited by planet-like bodies. The utility of the clock-like pulses emitted by pulsars [see Nature \n217, 709-713 (1968)] did not end with the insights they have yielded into the properties of neutron stars, and hence of high-density matter. In 1992, Wolszczan and Frail reported precise pulsar timing measurements which exhibited periodic variations. Unlike similar observations reported in the previous year (cited as ref. 3 in the paper), these variations were not an artefact, but revealed the presence of two or more planet-sized objects orbiting the neutron star — the first such objects to be detected outside the Solar System.",

We show that, contrary to the dominant paradigm, more than 55% of the global rise in mean BMI from 1985 to 2017—and more than 80% in some low- and middle-income regions—was due to increases in BMI in rural areas. This large contribution stems from the fact that, with the exception of women in sub-Saharan Africa, BMI is increasing at the same rate or faster in rural areas than in cities in low- and middle-income regions. These trends have in turn resulted in a closing—and in some countries reversal—of the gap in BMI between urban and rural areas in low- and middle-income countries, especially for women. In high-income and industrialized countries, we noted a persistently higher rural BMI, especially for women. There is an urgent need for an integrated approach to rural nutrition that enhances financial and physical access to healthy foods, to avoid replacing the rural undernutrition disadvantage in poor countries with a more general malnutrition disadvantage that entails excessive consumption of low-quality calories. Contrary to the view that urbanization is a major driver of the global rise in obesity, the global increase in body-mass index is shown to be mostly due to increases in the body-mass indexes of rural populations.",

		"desc": "ON bombarding uranium with neutrons, Fermi and collaborators1 found that at least four radioactive substances were produced, to two of which atomic numbers larger than 92 were ascribed. Further investigations2 demonstrated the existence of at least nine radioactive periods, six of which were assigned to elements beyond uranium, and nuclear isomerism had to be assumed in order to account for their chemical behaviour together with their genetic relations. In the late 1930s, a series of experiments showed that bombarding uranium with neutrons produced several new radioactive elements, which were assumed to have atomic numbers near to that of uranium (Z = 92). This assumption followed naturally from the prevailing view of nuclear decay, which involved the emission, through tunnelling, of only small charged particles (α and β). How then did one explain the formation of an element which was, as far as could be determined, identical to barium (Z = 56), and thus much smaller than uranium? The answer came in 1939, when Meitner and Frisch proposed a process whereby the addition of a neutron would induce the uranium nucleus to split. They called this process ‘fission’, by analogy with the splitting of living cells.",

While the emission process is still spin-allowed in these OLEDs, the efficiency limitations imposed by triplet excitons are circumvented for doublets. Using a luminescent radical emitter, we demonstrate an OLED with maximum external quantum efficiency of 27 per cent at a wavelength of 710 nanometres—the highest reported value for deep-red and infrared LEDs. For a standard closed-shell organic semiconductor, holes and electrons occupy the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs and LUMOs), respectively, and recombine to form singlet or triplet excitons. Radical emitters have a singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) in the ground state, giving an overall spin-1/2 doublet. If—as expected on energetic grounds—both electrons and holes occupy this SOMO level, recombination returns the system to the ground state, giving no light emission. However, in our very efficient OLEDs, we achieve selective hole injection into the HOMO and electron injection to the SOMO to form the fluorescent doublet excited state with near-unity internal quantum efficiency. Organic light-emitting devices containing radical emitters can achieve an efficiency of 27 per cent at deep-red and infrared wavelengths based on the excitation of spin doublets, rather than singlet or triplet states.",

The current process uses electroporation, sometimes followed by virus transduction. While this complex manipulation has resulted in high levels of gene editing at some genetic loci, cellular toxicity was observed. We have developed a CRISPR nanoformulation based on colloidal gold nanoparticles with a unique loading design capable of cellular entry without the need for electroporation or viruses. This highly monodispersed nanoformulation avoids lysosomal entrapment and localizes to the nucleus in primary human blood progenitors without toxicity. Nanoformulation-mediated gene editing is efficient and sustained with different CRISPR nucleases at multiple loci of therapeutic interest. The engraftment kinetics of nanoformulation-treated primary cells in humanized mice are better relative to those of non-treated cells, with no differences in differentiation. Here we demonstrate non-toxic delivery of the entire CRISPR payload into primary human blood progenitors. Gold nanoparticles that passively deliver CRISPR machinery to blood repopulating cells have been developed and are shown to be capable of precise editing of multiple genetic loci of therapeutic interest without cytotoxicity or reduced fitness.",

Here, we designed donor–acceptor neutral radicals based on an electron-poor perchlorotriphenylmethyl or tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl radical moiety combined with different electron-rich groups. Experimental and quantum-chemical studies demonstrate that the molecules do not follow the Aufbau principle: the singly occupied molecular orbital is found to lie below the highest (doubly) occupied molecular orbital. These donor–acceptor radicals have a strong emission yield (up to 54%) and high photostability, with estimated half-lives reaching up to several months under pulsed ultraviolet laser irradiation. Organic light-emitting diodes based on such a radical emitter show deep-red/near-infrared emission with a maximal external quantum efficiency of 5.3%. Our results provide a simple molecular-design strategy for stable, highly luminescent radicals with non-Aufbau electronic structures. Organic radical molecules violating the Aufbau principle are shown to reach high luminescence quantum yield and photostability, with potential applications for deep-red and near-infrared light-emitting sources.",

As a key biological building block, the stability and conformation of amides affect the structures of peptides and proteins as well as their biological function. In addition, amide-bond formation is one of the most frequently used chemical transformations3,4. Given their ubiquity, a technology that is capable of modifying the fundamental properties of amides without compromising on stability may have considerable potential in pharmaceutical, agrochemical and materials science. In order to influence the physical properties of organic molecules—such as solubility, lipophilicity, conformation, pKa and (metabolic) stability—fluorination approaches have been widely adopted5–7. Similarly, site-specific modification with isosteres and peptidomimetics8, or in particular by N-methylation9, has been used to improve the stability, physical properties, bioactivities and cellular permeabilities of compounds. However, the N-trifluoromethyl carbonyl motif—which combines both N-methylation and fluorination approaches—has not yet been explored, owing to a lack of efficient methodology to synthesize it. Here we report a straightforward method to access N-trifluoromethyl analogues of amides and related carbonyl compounds. The strategy relies on the operationally simple preparation of bench-stable carbamoyl fluoride building blocks, which can be readily diversified to the corresponding N–CF3 amides, carbamates, thiocarbamates and ureas. This method tolerates rich functionality and stereochemistry, and we present numerous examples of highly functionalized compounds—including analogues of widely used drugs, antibiotics, hormones and polymer units. N-trifluoromethyl analogues of amides and related carbonyl compounds are prepared via bench-stable carbamoyl fluoride building blocks.",

To assess whether RBC counting by automated urine sediment analyzers is reliable for defining hematuria in glomerular disease, random specimen urinalyses of men with nephritic glomerular disease (7674 urinalyses) and bladder cancer (12,510 urinalyses) were retrospectively reviewed. Urine RBCs were counted by an automated urine sediment analyzer based on flow cytometry (UF-1000i, Sysmex Corporation) or digital image analysis (Cobas 6500, Roche Diagnostics GmbH). In about 20% of urine specimens, the specific gravity was less than 1.010, making the RBC counts unreliable. In the urine specimens with specific gravity ≥ 1.010, RBC counts measured using either UF-1000i or Cobas 6500 were well correlated with the positive grades in the dipstick blood test. However, at a trace, 1+, or higher positive dipstick tests for blood, RBC counts were graded significantly lower in glomerular disease than in bladder cancer. The findings suggest that RBC counting by UF-1000i or Cobas 6500 underestimates the severity of hematuria in glomerular disease, possibly because dysmorphic RBCs in glomerular disease are susceptible to hemolysis and/or fail to be properly recognized.\n",

Deficiencies in glycogen formation cause neurodegenerative and metabolic disease2–4, and mouse knockout5 and inherited human mutations6 of GYG impair glycogen synthesis. GYG acts as a ‘seed core’ for the formation of the glycogen particle by catalysing its own stepwise autoglucosylation to form a covalently bound gluco-oligosaccharide chain at initiation site Tyr 195. Precise mechanistic studies have so far been prevented by an inability to access homogeneous glycoforms of this protein, which unusually acts as both catalyst and substrate. Here we show that unprecedented direct access to different, homogeneously glucosylated states of GYG can be accomplished through a palladium-mediated enzyme activation ‘shunt’ process using on-protein C–C bond formation. Careful mimicry of GYG intermediates recapitulates catalytic activity at distinct stages, which in turn allows discovery of triphasic kinetics and substrate plasticity in GYG’s use of sugar substrates. This reveals a tolerant but ‘proof-read’ mechanism that underlies the precision of this metabolic process. The present demonstration of direct, chemically controlled access to intermediate states of active enzymes suggests that such ligation-dependent activation could be a powerful tool in the study of mechanism. The mechanism of glycogenesis, initiated by glycogenin, involves three distinct kinetic phases, with the final phase involving a refining process where only glucose is tolerated as a substrate.",

This is partly due to the popular reception of Mary Shelley’s Monster, termed a ‘new species’ by its overreaching but admiringly determined maker Victor Frankenstein in the eponymous novel first published in 1818. The enduring impact of Shelley’s novel, which spans a plethora of subjects and genres in imagery and themes, raises questions of origin and identity, death, birth and family relationships, as well as the contradictory qualities of the monster. Monsters serve as metaphors for anxieties of aberration and innovation (Punter and Byron, 2004). Stephen Asma (2009) notes that monsters represent evil or moral transgression and each epoch, to speak with Michel Foucault (Abnormal: lectures at the Collège de France, 1975–75, 2003, p. 66), evidences a ‘particular type of monster’. Academic debates tend to explore how social and cultural threats come to be embodied in the figure of a monster and their actions literalise our deepest fears (Gilmore, 2009; Scott, 2007). Monsters in contemporary culture, however, have become more humane than ever before. Monsters are strong, resilient, creative and sly creatures. Through their playful and invigorating energy they can be seen to disrupt and unsettle. They still cater to the appetite for horror, but they also encourage us to feel empathy. The encounter with a monster can enable us to stop, wonder and change our attitudes towards technology, our body and each other. This commentary article considers the use of the concepts of ‘monsters’ or ‘monstrosity’ in literature, contemporary research, culture and teaching contexts at the intersection of the Humanities and the Social Sciences.",

In particular, it is difficult to quantitatively predict the emergent ‘classical’ properties of a system (for example, diffusivity, viscosity and compressibility) from a generic microscopic quantum Hamiltonian7–14. Here we introduce a hybrid solid-state spin platform, where the underlying disordered, dipolar quantum Hamiltonian gives rise to the emergence of unconventional spin diffusion at nanometre length scales. In particular, the combination of positional disorder and on-site random fields leads to diffusive dynamics that are Fickian yet non-Gaussian15–20. Finally, by tuning the underlying parameters within the spin Hamiltonian via a combination of static and driven fields, we demonstrate direct control over the emergent spin diffusion coefficient. Our work enables the investigation of hydrodynamics in many-body quantum spin systems. A hybrid solid-state platform based on two strongly interacting dipolar species is used to study the emergence of the classical properties of a solid from its underlying microscopic quantum description.",

The structure—together with our functional studies and molecular dynamics simulations—identifies a conserved sodium-binding site, reveals a potential lipid entry pathway and helps to rationalize MFSD2A mutations that underlie microcephaly syndromes. These results shed light on the critical lipid transport function of MFSD2A and provide a framework to aid in the design of specific modulators for therapeutic purposes. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of mouse MFSD2A sheds light on the mechanism that underlies its lipid transport functions, which have a pivotal role in regulating the blood–brain barrier.",

		"desc": "Robustness against disorder and defects is a pivotal advantage of topological systems1, manifested by the absence of electronic backscattering in the quantum-Hall2 and spin-Hall effects3, and by unidirectional waveguiding in their classical analogues4,5. Two-dimensional (2D) topological insulators4–13, in particular, provide unprecedented opportunities in a variety of fields owing to their compact planar geometries, which are compatible with the fabrication technologies used in modern electronics and photonics. Among all 2D topological phases, Chern insulators14–25 are currently the most reliable designs owing to the genuine backscattering immunity of their non-reciprocal edge modes, brought via time-reversal symmetry breaking. Yet such resistance to fabrication tolerances is limited to fluctuations of the same order of magnitude as their bandgap, limiting their resilience to small perturbations only. Here we investigate the robustness problem in a system where edge transmission can survive disorder levels with strengths arbitrarily larger than the bandgap—an anomalous non-reciprocal topological network. We explore the general conditions needed to obtain such an unusual effect in systems made of unitary three-port non-reciprocal scatterers connected by phase links, and establish the superior robustness of anomalous edge transmission modes over Chern ones to phase-link disorder of arbitrarily large values. We confirm experimentally the exceptional resilience of the anomalous phase, and demonstrate its operation in various arbitrarily shaped disordered multi-port prototypes. Our results pave the way to efficient, arbitrary planar energy transport on 2D substrates for wave devices with full protection against large fabrication flaws or imperfections. The physics of oriented topological graphs produces anomalous non-reciprocal topological edge states that have greater robustness to disorder and defects than the best performers at present: namely, Chern states.",

		"desc": "Cisplatin is a commonly used anticancer drug, but nephrotoxicity is a dose-limiting adverse effect. Recent experimental and clinical observations have demonstrated that multiple injections of cisplatin induce the transition to chronic kidney disease; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We found that multiple injections of higher doses of cisplatin in a shorter interval affected the severity of kidney injury, causing kidney fibrosis to develop at a later time point. An additional injection of cisplatin during the recovery period after a prior injury, when proximal tubule epithelia are actively proliferating, induced substantial tubular injury by inducing more severe DNA damage than that induced by a single injection. Lineage tracing analysis of proximal tubular epithelia demonstrated that the tubular epithelia that underwent multiple rounds of cell division after multiple injections of cisplatin existed at the chronic phase, and these populations often expressed vcam1 + , suggesting the induction of proinflammatory failed-repair tubular epithelia. Our study revealed that as cisplatin exerts cytotoxic effects on actively proliferating cells, additional cisplatin injections before the completion of tubular repair exacerbates kidney injury through cumulative DNA damage. Appropriate both the setting of dosage and dosing intervals, with careful monitoring, are essential to prevent nephrotoxicity of repeated cisplatin treatment in cancer patients.",

However, whether this mechanism is conserved among all classes of GPCR remains unknown. Here we report the structure of the class-C heterodimeric GABAB receptor, which is activated by the inhibitory transmitter GABA, in its active form complexed with Gi1 protein. We found that a single G protein interacts with the GB2 subunit of the GABAB receptor at a site that mainly involves intracellular loop 2 on the side of the transmembrane domain. This is in contrast to the G protein binding in a central cavity, as has been observed with other classes of GPCR. This binding mode results from the active form of the transmembrane domain of this GABAB receptor being different from that of other GPCRs, as it shows no outside movement of transmembrane helix 6. Our work also provides details of the inter- and intra-subunit changes that link agonist binding to G-protein activation in this heterodimeric complex. Cryo-electron microscopy structure of heterodimeric GABAB receptor in complex with Gi1 protein reveals that the mode of G-protein binding in this class-C G-protein-coupled receptor differs from that of other classes.",

Its skeletal system is composed of amorphous hydrated silica and is arranged in a highly regular and hierarchical cylindrical lattice that begets exceptional flexibility and resilience to damage3–6. Structural analyses dominate the literature, but hydrodynamic fields that surround and penetrate the sponge have remained largely unexplored. Here we address an unanswered question: whether, besides improving its mechanical properties, the skeletal motifs of E. aspergillum underlie the optimization of the flow physics within and beyond its body cavity. We use extreme flow simulations based on the ‘lattice Boltzmann’ method7, featuring over fifty billion grid points and spanning four spatial decades. These in silico experiments reproduce the hydrodynamic conditions on the deep-sea floor where E. aspergillum lives8–10. Our results indicate that the skeletal motifs reduce the overall hydrodynamic stress and support coherent internal recirculation patterns at low flow velocity. These patterns are arguably beneficial to the organism for selective filter feeding and sexual reproduction11,12. The present study reveals mechanisms of extraordinary adaptation to live in the abyss, paving the way towards further studies of this type at the intersection between fluid mechanics, organism biology and functional ecology. High-performance hydrodynamic simulations show that the skeletal structure of the deep-sea sponge Euplectella aspergillum reduces the hydrodynamic stresses on it, while possibly being beneficial for feeding and reproduction.",

In the case of pure water, this is estimated1 to require a pressure of 48 megabar, which is beyond current experimental capabilities and may only exist in the interior of large planets or stars2–4. Indeed, recent estimates and experiments indicate that water at pressures accessible in the laboratory will at best be superionic with high protonic conductivity5, but not metallic with conductive electrons1. Here we show that a metallic water solution can be prepared by massive doping with electrons upon reacting water with alkali metals. Although analogous metallic solutions of liquid ammonia with high concentrations of solvated electrons have long been known and characterized6–9, the explosive interaction between alkali metals and water10,11 has so far only permitted the preparation of aqueous solutions with low, submetallic electron concentrations12–14. We found that the explosive behaviour of the water–alkali metal reaction can be suppressed by adsorbing water vapour at a low pressure of about 10−4 millibar onto liquid sodium–potassium alloy drops ejected into a vacuum chamber. This set-up leads to the formation of a transient gold-coloured layer of a metallic water solution covering the metal alloy drops. The metallic character of this layer, doped with around 5 × 1021 electrons per cubic centimetre, is confirmed using optical reflection and synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. Spectroscopic measurements confirm that when water is adsorbed on drops of an alkali alloy at low pressure a gold-coloured metallic layer forms as electrons rapidly move from the drop into the water.",

Although synthetic protein functionalization strategies allow mimicry of PTMs3,4, as well as formation of unnatural protein variants with diverse potential functions, including drug carrying5, tracking, imaging6 and partner crosslinking7, the range of functional groups that can be introduced remains limited. Here we describe the visible-light-driven installation of side chains at dehydroalanine residues in proteins through the formation of carbon-centred radicals that allow C–C bond formation in water. Control of the reaction redox allows site-selective modification with good conversions and reduced protein damage. In situ generation of boronic acid catechol ester derivatives generates RH2C• radicals that form the native (β-CH2–γ-CH2) linkage of natural residues and PTMs, whereas in situ potentiation of pyridylsulfonyl derivatives by Fe(ii) generates RF2C• radicals that form equivalent β-CH2–γ-CF2 linkages bearing difluoromethylene labels. These reactions are chemically tolerant and incorporate a wide range of functionalities (more than 50 unique residues/side chains) into diverse protein scaffolds and sites. Initiation can be applied chemoselectively in the presence of sensitive groups in the radical precursors, enabling installation of previously incompatible side chains. The resulting protein function and reactivity are used to install radical precursors for homolytic on-protein radical generation; to study enzyme function with natural, unnatural and CF2-labelled post-translationally modified protein substrates via simultaneous sensing of both chemo- and stereoselectivity; and to create generalized ‘alkylator proteins’ with a spectrum of heterolytic covalent-bond-forming activity (that is, reacting diversely with small molecules at one extreme or selectively with protein targets through good mimicry at the other). Post-translational access to such reactions and chemical groups on proteins could be useful in both revealing and creating protein function. A wide range of side chains are installed into proteins by addition of photogenerated alkyl or difluroalkyl radicals, providing access to new functionality and reactivity in proteins.",

Unlike most medications for the treatment of substance use disorders, anecdotal reports suggest that ibogaine has the potential to treat addiction to various substances, including opiates, alcohol and psychostimulants. The effects of ibogaine—like those of other psychedelic compounds—are long-lasting2, which has been attributed to its ability to modify addiction-related neural circuitry through the activation of neurotrophic factor signalling3,4. However, several safety concerns have hindered the clinical development of ibogaine, including its toxicity, hallucinogenic potential and tendency to induce cardiac arrhythmias. Here we apply the principles of function-oriented synthesis to identify the key structural elements of the potential therapeutic pharmacophore of ibogaine, and we use this information to engineer tabernanthalog—a water-soluble, non-hallucinogenic, non-toxic analogue of ibogaine that can be prepared in a single step. In rodents, tabernanthalog was found to promote structural neural plasticity, reduce alcohol- and heroin-seeking behaviour, and produce antidepressant-like effects. This work demonstrates that, through careful chemical design, it is possible to modify a psychedelic compound to produce a safer, non-hallucinogenic variant that has therapeutic potential. Psychedelic alkaloids served as lead structures for the development of tabernanthalog, a non-hallucinogenic and non-toxic analogue that reduces alcohol- and heroin-seeking behaviour and produces antidepressant-like effects in rodents.",

There is growing evidence from metagenome-wide association studies that several common human disorders, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), are associated with intestinal dysbiosis, an unhealthy imbalance of the gut microbiota. However, the contribution of antidiabetic drug treatment to dysbiosis is often not accounted for. Oluf Pedersen and colleagues analysed two previous metagenomic studies of T2D patients that yielded divergent conclusions regarding the association of the disease with dysbiosis, together with a novel cohort, to determine the effects of the widely prescribed antidiabetic drug metformin. They find that metformin is indeed a confounding factor, but that a unified signature of gut microbiome shifts in T2D is still apparent. In recent years, several associations between common chronic human disorders and altered gut microbiome composition and function have been reported1,2. In most of these reports, treatment regimens were not controlled for and conclusions could thus be confounded by the effects of various drugs on the microbiota, which may obscure microbial causes, protective factors or diagnostically relevant signals. Our study addresses disease and drug signatures in the human gut microbiome of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Two previous quantitative gut metagenomics studies of T2D patients that were unstratified for treatment yielded divergent conclusions regarding its associated gut microbial dysbiosis3,4. Here we show, using 784 available human gut metagenomes, how antidiabetic medication confounds these results, and analyse in detail the effects of the most widely used antidiabetic drug metformin. We provide support for microbial mediation of the therapeutic effects of metformin through short-chain fatty acid production, as well as for potential microbiota-mediated mechanisms behind known intestinal adverse effects in the form of a relative increase in abundance of Escherichia species. Controlling for metformin treatment, we report a unified signature of gut microbiome shifts in T2D with a depletion of butyrate-producing taxa3,4. These in turn cause functional microbiome shifts, in part alleviated by metformin-induced changes. Overall, the present study emphasizes the need to disentangle gut microbiota signatures of specific human diseases from those of medication.",

		"desc": "More than three billion people rely on seafood for nutrition. However, fish are the predominant source of human exposure to methylmercury (MeHg), a potent neurotoxic substance. In the United States, 82% of population-wide exposure to MeHg is from the consumption of marine seafood and almost 40% is from fresh and canned tuna alone1. Around 80% of the inorganic mercury (Hg) that is emitted to the atmosphere from natural and human sources is deposited in the ocean2, where some is converted by microorganisms to MeHg. In predatory fish, environmental MeHg concentrations are amplified by a million times or more. Human exposure to MeHg has been associated with long-term neurocognitive deficits in children that persist into adulthood, with global costs to society that exceed US$20 billion3. The first global treaty on reductions in anthropogenic Hg emissions (the Minamata Convention on Mercury) entered into force in 2017. However, effects of ongoing changes in marine ecosystems on bioaccumulation of MeHg in marine predators that are frequently consumed by humans (for example, tuna, cod and swordfish) have not been considered when setting global policy targets. Here we use more than 30 years of data and ecosystem modelling to show that MeHg concentrations in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) increased by up to 23% between the 1970s and 2000s as a result of dietary shifts initiated by overfishing. Our model also predicts an estimated 56% increase in tissue MeHg concentrations in Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) due to increases in seawater temperature between a low point in 1969 and recent peak levels—which is consistent with 2017 observations. This estimated increase in tissue MeHg exceeds the modelled 22% reduction that was achieved in the late 1990s and 2000s as a result of decreased seawater MeHg concentrations. The recently reported plateau in global anthropogenic Hg emissions4 suggests that ocean warming and fisheries management programmes will be major drivers of future MeHg concentrations in marine predators. Overfishing and warming ocean temperature have caused an increase in methylmercury concentrations in some Atlantic predatory fish, and this trend is predicted to continue unless stronger mercury and carbon emissions standards are imposed.",

		"desc": "The use of particle accelerators as photon sources has enabled advances in science and technology1. Currently the workhorses of such sources are storage-ring-based synchrotron radiation facilities2–4 and linear-accelerator-based free-electron lasers5–14. Synchrotron radiation facilities deliver photons with high repetition rates but relatively low power, owing to their temporally incoherent nature. Free-electron lasers produce radiation with high peak brightness, but their repetition rate is limited by the driving sources. The steady-state microbunching15–22 (SSMB) mechanism has been proposed to generate high-repetition, high-power radiation at wavelengths ranging from the terahertz scale to the extreme ultraviolet. This is accomplished by using microbunching-enabled multiparticle coherent enhancement of the radiation in an electron storage ring on a steady-state turn-by-turn basis. A crucial step in unveiling the potential of SSMB as a future photon source is the demonstration of its mechanism in a real machine. Here we report an experimental demonstration of the SSMB mechanism. We show that electron bunches stored in a quasi-isochronous ring can yield sub-micrometre microbunching and coherent radiation, one complete revolution after energy modulation induced by a 1,064-nanometre-wavelength laser. Our results verify that the optical phases of electrons can be correlated turn by turn at a precision of sub-laser wavelengths. On the basis of this phase correlation, we expect that SSMB will be realized by applying a phase-locked laser that interacts with the electrons turn by turn. This demonstration represents a milestone towards the implementation of an SSMB-based high-repetition, high-power photon source. The mechanism of steady-state electron microbunching is demonstrated, providing a basis that will enable its full implementation in electron storage rings to generate high-repetition, high-power coherent radiation.",

Several studies have established that B.1.1.7 is more transmissible than pre-existing variants, but have not identified whether it leads to any change in disease severity2. Here we analyse a dataset that links 2,245,263 positive SARS-CoV-2 community tests and 17,452 deaths associated with COVID-19 in England from 1 November 2020 to 14 February 2021. For 1,146,534 (51%) of these tests, the presence or absence of B.1.1.7 can be identified because mutations in this lineage prevent PCR amplification of the spike (S) gene target (known as S gene target failure (SGTF)1). On the basis of 4,945 deaths with known SGTF status, we estimate that the hazard of death associated with SGTF is 55% (95% confidence interval, 39–72%) higher than in cases without SGTF after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, residence in a care home, the local authority of residence and test date. This corresponds to the absolute risk of death for a 55–69-year-old man increasing from 0.6% to 0.9% (95% confidence interval, 0.8–1.0%) within 28 days of a positive test in the community. Correcting for misclassification of SGTF and missingness in SGTF status, we estimate that the hazard of death associated with B.1.1.7 is 61% (42–82%) higher than with pre-existing variants. Our analysis suggests that B.1.1.7 is not only more transmissible than pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 variants, but may also cause more severe illness. Analysis of community-tested cases of SARS-CoV-2 indicates that the B.1.1.7 variant is not only more transmissible than pre-existing variants, but may also cause more severe illness, and is associated with a higher risk of death.",

The impacts arise from emissions of greenhouse gases, aerosols and nitrogen oxides, and from changes in cloudiness in the upper troposphere. An important but poorly understood component of this forcing is caused by ‘contrail cirrus’—a type of cloud that consist of young line-shaped contrails and the older irregularly shaped contrails that arise from them. Here we use a global climate model that captures the whole life cycle of these man-made clouds to simulate their global coverage, as well as the changes in natural cloudiness that they induce. We show that the radiative forcing associated with contrail cirrus as a whole is about nine times larger than that from line-shaped contrails alone. We also find that contrail cirrus cause a significant decrease in natural cloudiness, which partly offsets their warming effect. Nevertheless, net radiative forcing due to contrail cirrus remains the largest single radiative-forcing component associated with aviation. Our findings regarding global radiative forcing by contrail cirrus will allow their effects to be included in studies assessing the impacts of aviation on climate and appropriate mitigation options. Aviation is known to affect climate by changing cloudiness, but the magnitude of this effect remains uncertain. A modelling study indicates that changes in cloudiness associated with spreading of the line-shaped contrails that form behind aircraft may cause almost an order of magnitude more warming than the contrails alone.",

The neuronal circuitry and contribution of specific cellular populations underlying these behavioral adaptations remains unknown. A common characteristic of negative affect is a decrease in motivation to initiate and complete goal-directed behavior, known as anhedonia. We report that in rodents, inflammatory pain decreased the activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons, which are critical mediators of motivational states. Pain increased rostromedial tegmental nucleus inhibitory tone onto VTA DA neurons, making them less excitable. Furthermore, the decreased activity of DA neurons was associated with reduced motivation for natural rewards, consistent with anhedonia-like behavior. Selective activation of VTA DA neurons was sufficient to restore baseline motivation and hedonic responses to natural rewards. These findings reveal pain-induced adaptations within VTA DA neurons that underlie anhedonia-like behavior. Markovic et al. demonstrate in rodents that anhedonia-like states in inflammatory pain are mediated through increased inhibitory control and subsequent diminished activity of mesolimbic dopamine neurons.",

However, the bulk–edge correspondence—which has been widely used in experiments to determine the band topology from edge properties—is inadequate in discerning various topological crystalline phases7–16, leading to challenges in the experimental classification of the large family of topological crystalline materials4–6. It has been theoretically predicted that disclinations—ubiquitous crystallographic defects—can provide an effective probe of crystalline topology beyond edges17–19, but this has not yet been confirmed in experiments. Here we report an experimental demonstration of bulk–disclination correspondence, which manifests as fractional spectral charge and robust bound states at the disclinations. The fractional disclination charge originates from the symmetry-protected bulk charge patterns—a fundamental property of many topological crystalline insulators (TCIs). Furthermore, the robust bound states at disclinations emerge as a secondary, but directly observable, property of TCIs. Using reconfigurable photonic crystals as photonic TCIs with higher-order topology, we observe these hallmark features via pump–probe and near-field detection measurements. It is shown that both the fractional charge and the localized states emerge at the disclination in the TCI phase but vanish in the trivial phase. This experimental demonstration of bulk–disclination correspondence reveals a fundamental phenomenon and a paradigm for exploring topological materials. It is experimentally shown that topological states exist at crystallographic defects in the bulk and that disclination defects trap fractional charges characteristic of topological crystalline insulators.",

Because the two systems “coevolve” throughout multi-year simulations, we term this a “coevolutionary” modeling framework. The framework is used to demonstrate that a coordinated operating strategy could allow the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam to help meet water demands in Egypt during periods of water scarcity and increase hydropower generation and storage in Ethiopia during high flows. Here we show the hydrological and macroeconomic performance of this coordinated strategy compared to a strategy that resembles a recent draft proposal for the operation of the dam discussed in Washington DC. Integrating river system and economy-wide models in a dynamic, iterative, bidirectional fashion allows assessing some economic impacts of interventions in river systems. Here the authors use this framework to compare water resources management strategies for the Nile in a quest for efficient use of the river’s limited and stressed water resources.",

These aromatic amino acids may have been formed through Friedel–Crafts reactions catalysed by an iron-rich saponite clay during a late alteration stage of the massif serpentinites. Demonstrating the potential of fluid-rock interactions in the oceanic lithosphere to generate amino acids abiotically gives credence to the hydrothermal theory for the origin of life, and may shed light on ancient metabolisms and the functioning of the present-day deep biosphere. High-resolution imaging techniques show that aromatic amino acids such as tryptophan formed abiotically and were subsequently preserved at depth beneath the Atlantis Massif of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, supporting the hydrothermal theory for the origin of life.",

Here, we describe a dumbbell shape azobenzene diradical and correlate its solid-state flexibility with spin relaxation and mobility.

Heating leads to: i) a modulation of the spin distribution; and ii) a “normal” quinoidal → aromatic transformation at low temperatures driven by the intramolecular rotational vibrations of the azobenzene core and a “reversed” aromatic → quinoidal change at high temperatures activated by an azobenzene bicycle pedal motion amplified by anisotropic intermolecular interactions. Thermal excitation of these vibrational states modulates the diradical electronic and spin structures featuring vibronic coupling mechanisms that might be relevant for future design of high spin organic molecules with tunable magnetic properties for solid state spintronics. In this manuscript, Negri, Zheng, Casado et al develop a stable and flexible diradical.

Such materials are beneficial because they suppress spontaneous emission of light1 and are valued for their applications as optical waveguides, filters and laser resonators4, for improving light-harvesting technologies5–7 and for other applications4,8. Cubic diamond is preferred for these applications over more easily self-assembled structures, such as face-centred-cubic structures9,10, because diamond has a much wider bandgap and is less sensitive to imperfections11,12. In addition, the bandgap in diamond crystals appears at a refractive index contrast of about 2, which means that a photonic bandgap could be achieved using known materials at optical frequencies; this does not seem to be possible for face-centred-cubic crystals3,13. However, self-assembly of colloidal diamond is challenging. Because particles in a diamond lattice are tetrahedrally coordinated, one approach has been to self-assemble spherical particles with tetrahedral sticky patches14–16. But this approach lacks a mechanism to ensure that the patchy spheres select the staggered orientation of tetrahedral bonds on nearest-neighbour particles, which is required for cubic diamond15,17. Here we show that by using partially compressed tetrahedral clusters with retracted sticky patches, colloidal cubic diamond can be self-assembled using patch–patch adhesion in combination with a steric interlock mechanism that selects the required staggered bond orientation. Photonic bandstructure calculations reveal that the resulting lattices (direct and inverse) have promising optical properties, including a wide and complete photonic bandgap. The colloidal particles in the self-assembled cubic diamond structure are highly constrained and mechanically stable, which makes it possible to dry the suspension and retain the diamond structure. This makes these structures suitable templates for forming high-dielectric-contrast photonic crystals with cubic diamond symmetry. Self-assembly of cubic diamond crystals is demonstrated, by using precursor clusters of particles with carefully placed ‘sticky’ patches that attract and bind adjacent clusters in specific geometries.",

Only a small fraction of lithium-ion batteries are recycled, further exacerbating global material supply of strategic elements3–5. A potential alternative is to use organic-based redox-active materials6–8 to develop rechargeable batteries that originate from ethically sourced, sustainable materials and enable on-demand deconstruction and reconstruction. Making such batteries is challenging because the active materials must be stable during operation but degradable at end of life. Further, the degradation products should be either environmentally benign or recyclable for reconstruction into a new battery. Here we demonstrate a metal-free, polypeptide-based battery, in which viologens and nitroxide radicals are incorporated as redox-active groups along polypeptide backbones to function as anode and cathode materials, respectively. These redox-active polypeptides perform as active materials that are stable during battery operation and subsequently degrade on demand in acidic conditions to generate amino acids, other building blocks and degradation products. Such a polypeptide-based battery is a first step to addressing the need for alternative chemistries for green and sustainable batteries in a future circular economy. An environmentally friendly, all-organic radical battery is demonstrated, in which redox-active polypeptides perform as both cathode and anode materials, with a metal-free organic electrolyte.",

An adequate calorific intake but with insufficient protein consumption can lead to several ailments, including kwashiorkor1. Taste receptors (T1R1–T1R3)2 can detect amino acids in the environment, and cellular sensors (Gcn2 and Tor)3 monitor the levels of amino acids in the cell. When deprived of dietary protein, animals select a food source that contains a greater proportion of protein or essential amino acids (EAAs)4. This suggests that food selection is geared towards achieving the target amount of a particular macronutrient with assistance of the EAA-specific hunger-driven response, which is poorly understood. Here we show in Drosophila that a microbiome–gut–brain axis detects a deficit of EAAs and stimulates a compensatory appetite for EAAs. We found that the neuropeptide CNMamide (CNMa)5 was highly induced in enterocytes of the anterior midgut during protein deprivation. Silencing of the CNMa–CNMa receptor axis blocked the EAA-specific hunger-driven response in deprived flies. Furthermore, gnotobiotic flies bearing an EAA-producing symbiotic microbiome exhibited a reduced appetite for EAAs. By contrast, gnotobiotic flies with a mutant microbiome that did not produce leucine or other EAAs showed higher expression of CNMa and a greater compensatory appetite for EAAs. We propose that gut enterocytes sense the levels of diet- and microbiome-derived EAAs and communicate the EAA-deprived condition to the brain through CNMa. In Drosophila, an amino acid deficit triggers the expression of the neuropeptide CNMamide in gut enterocytes, which promotes a compensatory appetite for essential over non-essential amino acids, and this process is modulated by the microbiome.",

		"desc": "The performance of light microscopes is limited by the stochastic nature of light, which exists in discrete packets of energy known as photons. Randomness in the times that photons are detected introduces shot noise, which fundamentally constrains sensitivity, resolution and speed1. Although the long-established solution to this problem is to increase the intensity of the illumination light, this is not always possible when investigating living systems, because bright lasers can severely disturb biological processes2–4. Theory predicts that biological imaging may be improved without increasing light intensity by using quantum photon correlations1,5. Here we experimentally show that quantum correlations allow a signal-to-noise ratio beyond the photodamage limit of conventional microscopy. Our microscope is a coherent Raman microscope that offers subwavelength resolution and incorporates bright quantum correlated illumination. The correlations allow imaging of molecular bonds within a cell with a 35 per cent improved signal-to-noise ratio compared with conventional microscopy, corresponding to a 14 per cent improvement in concentration sensitivity. This enables the observation of biological structures that would not otherwise be resolved. Coherent Raman microscopes allow highly selective biomolecular fingerprinting in unlabelled specimens6,7, but photodamage is a major roadblock for many applications8,9. By showing that the photodamage limit can be overcome, our work will enable order-of-magnitude improvements in the signal-to-noise ratio and the imaging speed. A quantum microscope obtains signal-to-noise beyond the photodamage limits of conventional microscopy, revealing biological structures within cells that would not otherwise be resolved.",

Highly parallelized, fast and scalable hardware is therefore becoming progressively more important2. Here we demonstrate a computationally specific integrated photonic hardware accelerator (tensor core) that is capable of operating at speeds of trillions of multiply-accumulate operations per second (1012 MAC operations per second or tera-MACs per second). The tensor core can be considered as the optical analogue of an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). It achieves parallelized photonic in-memory computing using phase-change-material memory arrays and photonic chip-based optical frequency combs (soliton microcombs3). The computation is reduced to measuring the optical transmission of reconfigurable and non-resonant passive components and can operate at a bandwidth exceeding 14 gigahertz, limited only by the speed of the modulators and photodetectors. Given recent advances in hybrid integration of soliton microcombs at microwave line rates3–5, ultralow-loss silicon nitride waveguides6,7, and high-speed on-chip detectors and modulators, our approach provides a path towards full complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) wafer-scale integration of the photonic tensor core. Although we focus on convolutional processing, more generally our results indicate the potential of integrated photonics for parallel, fast, and efficient computational hardware in data-heavy AI applications such as autonomous driving, live video processing, and next-generation cloud computing services. An integrated photonic processor, based on phase-change-material memory arrays and chip-based optical frequency combs, which can operate at speeds of trillions of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations per second, is demonstrated.",

Density functional theory calculations reveal that the strong interactions between different metal sites in HEA SNWs can greatly regulate the binding strength of proton and hydroxyl, and therefore enhances the HOR activity. This work not only provides a viable synthetic route for the fabrication of Pt-based HEA subnano/nano materials, but also promotes the fundamental researches on catalysis and beyond.

Active transport allows cells to store metabolic energy, extract waste and supply organelles with basic building blocks at the submicrometre scale. Unlike living cells, abiotic systems do not have the delicate biochemical machinery that can be specifically activated to precisely control biological matter2–5. Here we report the creation of microcapsules that can be brought out of equilibrium by simple global variables (illumination and pH), to capture, concentrate, store and deliver generic microscopic payloads. Borrowing no materials from biology, our design uses hollow colloids serving as spherical cell-membrane mimics, with a well-defined single micropore. Precisely tunable monodisperse capsules are the result of a synthetic self-inflation mechanism and can be produced in bulk quantities. Inside the hollow unit, a photoswitchable catalyst6 produces a chemical gradient that propagates to the exterior through the membrane’s micropore and pumps target objects into the cell, acting as a phoretic tractor beam7. An entropic energy barrier8,9 brought about by the micropore’s geometry retains the cargo even when the catalyst is switched off. Delivery is accomplished on demand by reversing the sign of the phoretic interaction. Our findings provide a blueprint for developing the next generation of smart materials, autonomous micromachinery and artificial cell-mimics. Hollow colloidal capsules, each with a single micropore, act as artificial cell-like structures that can capture and release payloads such as solid particles or bacteria from the external environment.",

Fossil fuel extraction and use are among the largest anthropogenic sources of CH4 emissions, but the precise magnitude of these contributions is a subject of debate2,3. Carbon-14 in CH4 (14CH4) can be used to distinguish between fossil (14C-free) CH4 emissions and contemporaneous biogenic sources; however, poorly constrained direct 14CH4 emissions from nuclear reactors have complicated this approach since the middle of the 20th century4,5. Moreover, the partitioning of total fossil CH4 emissions (presently 172 to 195 teragrams CH4 per year)2,3 between anthropogenic and natural geological sources (such as seeps and mud volcanoes) is under debate; emission inventories suggest that the latter account for about 40 to 60 teragrams CH4 per year6,7. Geological emissions were less than 15.4 teragrams CH4 per year at the end of the Pleistocene, about 11,600 years ago8, but that period is an imperfect analogue for present-day emissions owing to the large terrestrial ice sheet cover, lower sea level and extensive permafrost. Here we use preindustrial-era ice core 14CH4 measurements to show that natural geological CH4 emissions to the atmosphere were about 1.6 teragrams CH4 per year, with a maximum of 5.4 teragrams CH4 per year (95 per cent confidence limit)—an order of magnitude lower than the currently used estimates. This result indicates that anthropogenic fossil CH4 emissions are underestimated by about 38 to 58 teragrams CH4 per year, or about 25 to 40 per cent of recent estimates. Our record highlights the human impact on the atmosphere and climate, provides a firm target for inventories of the global CH4 budget, and will help to inform strategies for targeted emission reductions9,10. Isotopic evidence from ice cores indicates that preindustrial-era geological methane emissions were lower than previously thought, suggesting that present-day emissions of methane from fossil fuels are underestimated.",

Planar-fabricated optics integrated within ion-trap devices can make such systems simultaneously more robust and parallelizable, as suggested by previous work with single ions4. Here we use scalable optics co-fabricated with a surface-electrode ion trap to achieve high-fidelity multi-ion quantum logic gates, which are often the limiting elements in building up the precise, large-scale entanglement that is essential to quantum computation. Light is efficiently delivered to a trap chip in a cryogenic environment via direct fibre coupling on multiple channels, eliminating the need for beam alignment into vacuum systems and cryostats and lending robustness to vibrations and beam-pointing drifts. This allows us to perform ground-state laser cooling of ion motion and to implement gates generating two-ion entangled states with fidelities greater than 99.3(2) per cent. This work demonstrates hardware that reduces noise and drifts in sensitive quantum logic, and simultaneously offers a route to practical parallelization for high-fidelity quantum processors5. Similar devices may also find applications in atom- and ion-based quantum sensing and timekeeping6.

Unique opportunities for mitigation are presented by point-source emitters—surface features or infrastructure components that are typically less than 10 metres in diameter and emit plumes of highly concentrated methane3. However, data on point-source emissions are sparse and typically lack sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to guide their mitigation and to accurately assess their magnitude4. Here we survey more than 272,000 infrastructure elements in California using an airborne imaging spectrometer that can rapidly map methane plumes5–7. We conduct five campaigns over several months from 2016 to 2018, spanning the oil and gas, manure-management and waste-management sectors, resulting in the detection, geolocation and quantification of emissions from 564 strong methane point sources. Our remote sensing approach enables the rapid and repeated assessment of large areas at high spatial resolution for a poorly characterized population of methane emitters that often appear intermittently and stochastically. We estimate net methane point-source emissions in California to be 0.618 teragrams per year (95 per cent confidence interval 0.523–0.725), equivalent to 34–46 per cent of the state’s methane inventory8 for 2016. Methane ‘super-emitter’ activity occurs in every sector surveyed, with 10 per cent of point sources contributing roughly 60 per cent of point-source emissions—consistent with a study of the US Four Corners region that had a different sectoral mix9. The largest methane emitters in California are a subset of landfills, which exhibit persistent anomalous activity. Methane point-source emissions in California are dominated by landfills (41 per cent), followed by dairies (26 per cent) and the oil and gas sector (26 per cent). Our data have enabled the identification of the 0.2 per cent of California’s infrastructure that is responsible for these emissions. Sharing these data with collaborating infrastructure operators has led to the mitigation of anomalous methane-emission activity10. Emission of methane from ‘point sources’—small surface features or infrastructure components—is monitored with an airborne spectrometer, identifying possible targets for mitigation efforts.",

All of the teeth in this study were extracted, and eight teeth in total were scanned on a CBCT scanner, a microCT scanner and on a PCSCT scanner. Six of the teeth that were scanned have accessory canals, one has a titanium rod attached to it, and one has a gutta-percha point inside it. Qualitative analysis was done to compare the different imaging modalities. The subjective image analysis demonstrated similar performance in AC detection and visualisation for PCSCT and CBCT (p value >0.05). Both PCSCT and microCT performed similarly for metal artefact reduction, and both were superior to CBCT (p value <0.05). Although microCT provides detailed information about small anatomical structures, it is not suitable for in vivo use. However, the PCSCT scanner was able to detect small anatomical structures in teeth comparable to CBCT, as well as being superior in reducing metal artefacts from dental implants.

Although temperature controls the storage of soil organic carbon at mid and high latitudes2,3, hydroclimate may be the dominant driver of soil carbon persistence in the tropics4,5; however, the sensitivity of tropical soil carbon turnover to large-scale hydroclimate variability remains poorly understood. Here we show that changes in Indian Summer Monsoon rainfall have controlled the residence time of soil carbon in the Ganges–Brahmaputra basin over the past 18,000 years. Comparison of radiocarbon ages of bulk organic carbon and terrestrial higher-plant biomarkers with co-located palaeohydrological records6 reveals a negative relationship between monsoon rainfall and soil organic carbon stocks on a millennial timescale. Across the deglaciation period, a depletion of basin-wide soil carbon stocks was triggered by increasing rainfall and associated enhanced soil respiration rates. Our results suggest that future hydroclimate changes in tropical regions are likely to accelerate soil carbon destabilization, further increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Over the past 18,000 years, the residence time and amount of soil carbon stored in the Ganges–Brahmaputra basin have been controlled by the intensity of Indian Summer Monsoon rainfall, with greater carbon destabilization during wetter, warmer conditions.",

By contrast, self-assembly is a scalable technique, where complex materials can selectively form in solution4–6. Here we show a synthetic strategy for the self-assembly of layered perovskite–non-perovskite heterostructures into large single crystals in aqueous solution. Using bifunctional organic molecules as directing groups, we have isolated six layered heterostructures that form as an interleaving of perovskite slabs with a different inorganic lattice, previously unknown to crystallize with perovskites. In many cases, these intergrown lattices are 2D congeners of canonical inorganic structure types. To our knowledge, these compounds are the first layered perovskite heterostructures formed using organic templates and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Notably, this interleaving of inorganic structures can markedly transform the band structure. Optical data and first principles calculations show that substantive coupling between perovskite and intergrowth layers leads to new electronic transitions distributed across both sublattices. Given the technological promise of halide perovskites4, this intuitive synthetic route sets a foundation for the directed synthesis of richly structured complex semiconductors that self-assemble in water.

Colonization of germ-free mice with microbiota has been previously reported to promote vascular growth in the small intestine. Understanding the underlying mechanism for this process may provide new therapeutic targets for wound healing and ischaemic conditions, and for modifying the absorptive capacity of the gut. Frederik Bäckhed and colleagues identify three factors involved in microbiota-induced vascular development: tissue factor, PAR1 and Ang-1. The three signalling components are localized in the enterocytes, epithelial cells that are directly exposed to the gut microbiota. The gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem that has coevolved with host physiology. Colonization of germ-free (GF) mice with a microbiota promotes increased vessel density in the small intestine1, but little is known about the mechanisms involved. Tissue factor (TF) is the membrane receptor that initiates the extrinsic coagulation pathway2, and it promotes developmental and tumour angiogenesis3,4. Here we show that the gut microbiota promotes TF glycosylation associated with localization of TF on the cell surface, the activation of coagulation proteases, and phosphorylation of the TF cytoplasmic domain in the small intestine. Anti-TF treatment of colonized GF mice decreased microbiota-induced vascular remodelling and expression of the proangiogenic factor angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) in the small intestine. Mice with a genetic deletion of the TF cytoplasmic domain or with hypomorphic TF (F3) alleles had a decreased intestinal vessel density. Coagulation proteases downstream of TF activate protease-activated receptor (PAR) signalling implicated in angiogenesis5. Vessel density and phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of TF were decreased in small intestine from PAR1-deficient (F2r−/−) but not PAR2-deficient (F2rl1−/−) mice, and inhibition of thrombin showed that thrombin–PAR1 signalling was upstream of TF phosphorylation. Thus, the microbiota-induced extravascular TF–PAR1 signalling loop is a novel pathway that may be modulated to influence vascular remodelling in the small intestine.",

We propose that it is plausible that the origin of some waterfalls in natural systems can be attributed to this intrinsic formation process and we suggest that investigations to distinguish self-formed from externally forced waterfalls may help to improve the reconstruction of Earth history from landscapes.

The targeting of transposable elements by PIWI has been compared to mRNA target recognition by Argonaute proteins2,3, which use microRNA (miRNA) guides, but the extent to which piRNAs resemble miRNAs is not known. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of a PIWI–piRNA complex from the sponge Ephydatia fluviatilis with and without target RNAs, and a biochemical analysis of target recognition. Mirroring Argonaute, PIWI identifies targets using the piRNA seed region. However, PIWI creates a much weaker seed so that stable target association requires further piRNA–target pairing, making piRNAs less promiscuous than miRNAs. Beyond the seed, the structure of PIWI facilitates piRNA–target pairing in a manner that is tolerant of mismatches, leading to long-lived PIWI–piRNA–target interactions that may accumulate on transposable-element transcripts. PIWI ensures targeting fidelity by physically blocking the propagation of piRNA–target interactions in the absence of faithful seed pairing, and by requiring an extended piRNA–target duplex to reach an endonucleolytically active conformation. PIWI proteins thereby minimize off-targeting cellular mRNAs while defending against evolving genomic threats. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of a PIWI–piRNA complex provide insight into how piRNAs recognise target RNAs and reveal differences from the target mechanisms of microRNAs.",

		"desc": "Vascularization is critical for skull development, maintenance, and healing. Yet, there remains a significant knowledge gap in the relationship of blood vessels to cranial skeletal progenitors during these processes. Here, we introduce a quantitative 3D imaging platform to enable the visualization and analysis of high-resolution data sets (>100 GB) throughout the entire murine calvarium. Using this technique, we provide single-cell resolution 3D maps of vessel phenotypes and skeletal progenitors in the frontoparietal cranial bones. Through these high-resolution data sets, we demonstrate that CD31hiEmcnhi vessels are spatially correlated with both Osterix+ and Gli1+ skeletal progenitors during postnatal growth, healing, and stimulated remodeling, and are concentrated at transcortical canals and osteogenic fronts. Interestingly, we find that this relationship is weakened in mice with a conditional knockout of PDGF-BB in TRAP+ osteoclasts, suggesting a potential role for osteoclasts in maintaining the native cranial microvascular environment. Our findings provide a foundational framework for understanding how blood vessels and skeletal progenitors spatially interact in cranial bone, and will enable more targeted studies into the mechanisms of skull disease pathologies and treatments. Additionally, our technique can be readily adapted to study numerous cell types and investigate other elusive phenomena in cranial bone biology. Vascularization is critical for cranial bone growth, maintenance, and healing, but it remains unknown how blood vessels are spatially distributed in the calvarium, and how they interact with skeletal progenitors during these processes. Here, the authors apply a quantitative light-sheet imaging platform to visualize and analyze the relationship between blood vessels and skeletal progenitors throughout the murine calvarium.",

However, traditional methods, such as thin-section EM or EM tomography, have limitations in that they visualize only a single slice or a relatively small volume of the cell, respectively. Focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) has demonstrated the ability to image small volumes of cellular samples with 4-nm isotropic voxels1. Owing to advances in the precision and stability of FIB milling, together with enhanced signal detection and faster SEM scanning, we have increased the volume that can be imaged with 4-nm voxels by two orders of magnitude. Here we present a volume EM atlas at such resolution comprising ten three-dimensional datasets for whole cells and tissues, including cancer cells, immune cells, mouse pancreatic islets and Drosophila neural tissues. These open access data (via OpenOrganelle2) represent the foundation of a field of high-resolution whole-cell volume EM and subsequent analyses, and we invite researchers to explore this atlas and pose questions.

		"desc": "A freely available dataset produced from three million Landsat satellite images reveals substantial changes in the distribution of global surface water over the past 32 years and their causes, from climate change to human actions. The distribution of surface water has been mapped globally, and local-to-regional studies have tracked changes over time. But to date, there has been no global and methodologically consistent quantification of changes in surface water over time. Jean-François Pekel and colleagues have analysed more than three million Landsat images to quantify month-to-month changes in surface water at a resolution of 30 metres and over a 32-year period. They find that surface waters have declined by almost 90,000 square kilometres—largely in the Middle East and Central Asia—but that surface waters equivalent to about twice that area have been created elsewhere. Drought, reservoir creation and water extraction appear to have driven most of the changes in surface water over the past decades. The location and persistence of surface water (inland and coastal) is both affected by climate and human activity1 and affects climate2,3, biological diversity4 and human wellbeing5,6. Global data sets documenting surface water location and seasonality have been produced from inventories and national descriptions7, statistical extrapolation of regional data8 and satellite imagery9,10,11,12, but measuring long-term changes at high resolution remains a challenge. Here, using three million Landsat satellite images13, we quantify changes in global surface water over the past 32 years at 30-metre resolution. We record the months and years when water was present, where occurrence changed and what form changes took in terms of seasonality and persistence. Between 1984 and 2015 permanent surface water has disappeared from an area of almost 90,000 square kilometres, roughly equivalent to that of Lake Superior, though new permanent bodies of surface water covering 184,000 square kilometres have formed elsewhere. All continental regions show a net increase in permanent water, except Oceania, which has a fractional (one per cent) net loss. Much of the increase is from reservoir filling, although climate change14 is also implicated. Loss is more geographically concentrated than gain. Over 70 per cent of global net permanent water loss occurred in the Middle East and Central Asia, linked to drought and human actions including river diversion or damming and unregulated withdrawal15,16. Losses in Australia17 and the USA18 linked to long-term droughts are also evident. This globally consistent, validated data set shows that impacts of climate change and climate oscillations on surface water occurrence can be measured and that evidence can be gathered to show how surface water is altered by human activities. We anticipate that this freely available data will improve the modelling of surface forcing, provide evidence of state and change in wetland ecotones (the transition areas between biomes), and inform water-management decision-making.",

However, a lack of water level observations for the world’s ponds, lakes and reservoirs has limited the quantification of human-managed (reservoir) changes in surface water storage compared to its natural variability3. The global storage variability in surface water bodies and the extent to which it is altered by humans therefore remain unknown. Here we show that 57 per cent of the Earth’s seasonal surface water storage variability occurs in human-managed reservoirs. Using measurements from NASA’s ICESat-2 satellite laser altimeter, which was launched in late 2018, we assemble an extensive global water level dataset that quantifies water level variability for 227,386 water bodies from October 2018 to July 2020. We find that seasonal variability in human-managed reservoirs averages 0.86 metres, whereas natural water bodies vary by only 0.22 metres. Natural variability in surface water storage is greatest in tropical basins, whereas human-managed variability is greatest in the Middle East, southern Africa and the western USA. Strong regional patterns are also found, with human influence driving 67 per cent of surface water storage variability south of 45 degrees north and nearly 100 per cent in certain arid and semi-arid regions. As economic development, population growth and climate change continue to pressure global water resources4, our approach provides a useful baseline from which ICESat-2 and future satellite missions will be able to track human modifications to the global hydrologic cycle. Data from the ICESat-2 satellite quantifying the variability of water levels in natural and human-managed water bodies show that a disproportionate majority of global water storage variability occurs in human-managed reservoirs.",

Even if a direct viral tropism of intestinal cells has recently been demonstrated, it remains unclear, whether gastrointestinal symptoms are caused by direct infection of the gastrointestinal tract by SARS-CoV-2 or whether they are a consequence of a systemic immune activation and subsequent modulation of the mucosal immune system. To better understand the cause of intestinal symptoms we analyzed biopsies of the small intestine from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Applying qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, we detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA and nucleocapsid protein in duodenal mucosa. In addition, applying imaging mass cytometry and immunohistochemistry, we identified histomorphological changes of the epithelium, which were characterized by an accumulation of activated intraepithelial CD8+ T cells as well as epithelial apoptosis and subsequent regenerative proliferation in the small intestine of COVID-19 patients. In summary, our findings indicate that intraepithelial CD8+ T cells are activated upon infection of intestinal epithelial cells with SARS-CoV-2, providing one possible explanation for gastrointestinal symptoms associated with COVID-19.",

Academics and practitioners alike have asked why people share such misinformation, and sought solutions to reduce the sharing of misinformation5–7. Here, we attempt to address both of these questions. First, we find that the veracity of headlines has little effect on sharing intentions, despite having a large effect on judgments of accuracy. This dissociation suggests that sharing does not necessarily indicate belief. Nonetheless, most participants say it is important to share only accurate news. To shed light on this apparent contradiction, we carried out four survey experiments and a field experiment on Twitter; the results show that subtly shifting attention to accuracy increases the quality of news that people subsequently share. Together with additional computational analyses, these findings indicate that people often share misinformation because their attention is focused on factors other than accuracy—and therefore they fail to implement a strongly held preference for accurate sharing. Our results challenge the popular claim that people value partisanship over accuracy8,9, and provide evidence for scalable attention-based interventions that social media platforms could easily implement to counter misinformation online. Surveys and a field experiment with Twitter users show that prompting people to think about the accuracy of news sources increases the quality of the news that they share online.",

It has been suggested that the oceanic deposition of wildfire aerosols can relieve nutrient limitations and, consequently, enhance marine productivity11,12, but direct observations are lacking. Here we use satellite and autonomous biogeochemical Argo float data to evaluate the effect of 2019–2020 Australian wildfire aerosol deposition on phytoplankton productivity. We find anomalously widespread phytoplankton blooms from December 2019 to March 2020 in the Southern Ocean downwind of Australia. Aerosol samples originating from the Australian wildfires contained a high iron content and atmospheric trajectories show that these aerosols were likely to be transported to the bloom regions, suggesting that the blooms resulted from the fertilization of the iron-limited waters of the Southern Ocean. Climate models project more frequent and severe wildfires in many regions1–3. A greater appreciation of the links between wildfires, pyrogenic aerosols13, nutrient cycling and marine photosynthesis could improve our understanding of the contemporary and glacial–interglacial cycling of atmospheric CO2 and the global climate system.

The collapse of ice shelves that buttress11–13 the ice sheet accelerates ice flow and sea-level rise14–16. However, we do not know if and how much of the buttressing regions of Antarctica’s ice shelves are vulnerable to hydrofracture if inundated with water. Here we provide two lines of evidence suggesting that many buttressing regions are vulnerable. First, we trained a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to map the surface expressions of fractures in satellite imagery across all Antarctic ice shelves. Second, we developed a stability diagram of fractures based on linear elastic fracture mechanics to predict where basal and dry surface fractures form under current stress conditions. We find close agreement between the theoretical prediction and the DCNN-mapped fractures, despite limitations associated with detecting fractures in satellite imagery. Finally, we used linear elastic fracture mechanics theory to predict where surface fractures would become unstable if filled with water. Many regions regularly inundated with meltwater today are resilient to hydrofracture—stresses are low enough that all water-filled fractures are stable. Conversely, 60 ± 10 per cent of ice shelves (by area) both buttress upstream ice and are vulnerable to hydrofracture if inundated with water. The DCNN map confirms the presence of fractures in these buttressing regions. Increased surface melting17 could trigger hydrofracturing if it leads to water inundating the widespread vulnerable regions we identify. These regions are where atmospheric warming may have the largest impact on ice-sheet mass balance. Using a neural network trained on continent-wide data and a fracture model, the ice shelves in Antarctica that may be prone to hydrofracturing under further atmospheric warming are identified.",

In addition, the OXPHOS uses O2 to produce reactive oxygen species that can drive cell adaptations1–4, a phenomenon that occurs in hypoxia4–8 and whose precise mechanism remains unknown. Ca2+ is the best known ion that acts as a second messenger9, yet the role ascribed to Na+ is to serve as a mere mediator of membrane potential10. Here we show that Na+ acts as a second messenger that regulates OXPHOS function and the production of reactive oxygen species by modulating the fluidity of the inner mitochondrial membrane. A conformational shift in mitochondrial complex I during acute hypoxia11 drives acidification of the matrix and the release of free Ca2+ from calcium phosphate (CaP) precipitates. The concomitant activation of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger promotes the import of Na+ into the matrix. Na+ interacts with phospholipids, reducing inner mitochondrial membrane fluidity and the mobility of free ubiquinone between complex II and complex III, but not inside supercomplexes. As a consequence, superoxide is produced at complex III. The inhibition of Na+ import through the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is sufficient to block this pathway, preventing adaptation to hypoxia. These results reveal that Na+ controls OXPHOS function and redox signalling through an unexpected interaction with phospholipids, with profound consequences for cellular metabolism. Na+ controls the function of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system and hypoxic redox signalling through an unexpected interaction with phospholipids.",

The model generated astrocyte-specific gene expression patterns during differentiation that corresponded well to astroglia-specific expression signatures of in vivo cortical fetal development. Using this model we identified SCZ-specific expression dynamics, and found that SCZ-associated differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in the medial prefrontal cortex, striatum, and temporal lobe, targeting VWA5A and ADAMTS19.

Like waves on water, magnetopause surface waves are thought to travel in the direction of the driving solar wind, hence a paradigm in global magnetospheric dynamics of tailward propagation has been well-established. Here we show through multi-spacecraft observations, global simulations, and analytic theory that the lowest-frequency impulsively-excited magnetopause surface waves, with standing structure along the terrestrial magnetic field, propagate against the flow outside the boundary. Across a wide local time range (09–15h) the waves’ Poynting flux exactly balances the flow’s advective effect, leading to no net energy flux and thus stationary structure across the field also. Further down the equatorial flanks, however, advection dominates hence the waves travel downtail, seeding fluctuations at the resonant frequency which subsequently grow in amplitude via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and couple to magnetospheric body waves. This global response, contrary to the accepted paradigm, has implications on radiation belt, ionospheric, and auroral dynamics and potential applications to other dynamical systems. The magnetopause surface waves (SW) that drive global plasma dynamics are thought, like waves on water, to travel with the driving solar wind. Here, the authors show that impulsively-excited SW, with standing structure along the geomagnetic field, are stationary by propagating against this flow.",

The conditions required for water to have initially condensed on the surface of Solar System terrestrial planets are highly uncertain, as they have so far only been studied with one-dimensional numerical climate models3 that cannot account for the effects of atmospheric circulation and clouds, which are key climate stabilizers. Here we show using three-dimensional global climate model simulations of early Venus and Earth that water clouds—which preferentially form on the nightside, owing to the strong subsolar water vapour absorption—have a strong net warming effect that inhibits surface water condensation even at modest insolations (down to 325 watts per square metre, that is, 0.95 times the Earth solar constant). This shows that water never condensed and that, consequently, oceans never formed on the surface of Venus. Furthermore, this shows that the formation of Earth’s oceans required much lower insolation than today, which was made possible by the faint young Sun. This also implies the existence of another stability state for present-day Earth: the ‘steam Earth’, with all the water from the oceans evaporated into the atmosphere. Global climate model simulations of early Venus and Earth show that differences in the cloud regimes prevented ocean formation on Venus but not on Earth.",

However, none of the candidate compounds reported5–7 meet all the criteria for a locust aggregation pheromone. Here, using behavioural assays, electrophysiological recording, olfactory receptor characterization and field experiments, we demonstrate that 4-vinylanisole (4VA) (also known as 4-methoxystyrene) is an aggregation pheromone of the migratory locust (Locusta migratoria). Both gregarious and solitary locusts are strongly attracted to 4VA, regardless of age and sex. Although it is emitted specifically by gregarious locusts, 4VA production can be triggered by aggregation of four to five solitary locusts. It elicits responses specifically from basiconic sensilla on locust antennae. We also identified OR35 as a specific olfactory receptor of 4VA. Knockout of OR35 using CRISPR–Cas9 markedly reduced the electrophysiological responses of the antennae and impaired 4VA behavioural attractiveness. Finally, field trapping experiments verified the attractiveness of 4VA to experimental and wild populations. These findings identify a locust aggregation pheromone and provide insights for the development of novel control strategies for locusts. 4-Vinylanisole, which is emitted by gregarious locusts or as a result of aggregation of solitary locusts, is identified as an aggregation pheromone that strongly attracts both solitary and gregarious locusts, acting via the olfactory receptor OR35.",

Most characterized enzymatic pericyclic reactions have been cycloadditions, and it has been difficult to rationalize how the observed selectivities are achieved2–13. Here we report the discovery of two homologous groups of pericyclases that catalyse distinct reactions: one group catalyses an Alder-ene reaction that was, to our knowledge, previously unknown in biology; the second catalyses a stereoselective hetero-Diels–Alder reaction. Guided by computational studies, we have rationalized the observed differences in reactivities and designed mutant enzymes that reverse periselectivities from Alder-ene to hetero-Diels–Alder and vice versa. A combination of in vitro biochemical characterizations, computational studies, enzyme co-crystal structures, and mutational studies illustrate how high regioselectivity and periselectivity are achieved in nearly identical active sites.

In the visual system, these feedforward pathways define the classical feedforward receptive field (ffRF), the area in space in which visual stimuli excite a neuron1. The visual system also uses visual context—the visual scene surrounding a stimulus—to predict the content of the stimulus2, and accordingly, neurons have been identified that are excited by stimuli outside their ffRF3–8. However, the mechanisms that generate excitation to stimuli outside the ffRF are unclear. Here we show that feedback projections onto excitatory neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex generate a second receptive field that is driven by stimuli outside the ffRF. The stimulation of this feedback receptive field (fbRF) elicits responses that are slower and are delayed in comparison with those resulting from the stimulation of the ffRF. These responses are preferentially reduced by anaesthesia and by silencing higher visual areas. Feedback inputs from higher visual areas have scattered receptive fields relative to their putative targets in the primary visual cortex, which enables the generation of the fbRF. Neurons with fbRFs are located in cortical layers that receive strong feedback projections and are absent in the main input layer, which is consistent with a laminar processing hierarchy. The observation that large, uniform stimuli—which cover both the fbRF and the ffRF—suppress these responses indicates that the fbRF and the ffRF are mutually antagonistic. Whereas somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons are driven by these large stimuli, inhibitory neurons that express parvalbumin and vasoactive intestinal peptide have mutually antagonistic fbRF and ffRF, similar to excitatory neurons. Feedback projections may therefore enable neurons to use context to estimate information that is missing from the ffRF and to report differences in stimulus features across visual space, regardless of whether excitation occurs inside or outside the ffRF. By complementing the ffRF, the fbRF that we identify here could contribute to predictive processing. Feedback projections onto neurons of the mouse primary visual cortex generate a second excitatory receptive field that is driven by stimuli outside of the classical feedforward receptive field, with responses mediated by higher visual areas.",

		"desc": "It has recently been shown that in anaerobic microorganisms the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, including the seemingly irreversible citrate synthase reaction, can be reversed and used for autotrophic fixation of carbon1,2. This reversed oxidative TCA cycle requires ferredoxin-dependent 2-oxoglutarate synthase instead of the NAD-dependent dehydrogenase as well as extremely high levels of citrate synthase (more than 7% of the proteins in the cell). In this pathway, citrate synthase replaces ATP-citrate lyase of the reductive TCA cycle, which leads to the spending of one ATP-equivalent less per one turn of the cycle. Here we show, using the thermophilic sulfur-reducing deltaproteobacterium Hippea maritima, that this route is driven by high partial pressures of CO2. These high partial pressures are especially important for the removal of the product acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) through reductive carboxylation to pyruvate, which is catalysed by pyruvate synthase. The reversed oxidative TCA cycle may have been functioning in autotrophic CO2 fixation in a primordial atmosphere that is assumed to have been rich in CO2. In the deltaproteobacterium Hippea maritima, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle can be reversed by high partial pressures of CO2 for the autotrophic fixation of carbon.",

Our results show an overall agreement with a state-counting model based on statistical theory4–6, but also reveal several deviating state-pairs. In particular, we observe a strong suppression of population in the state-pair closest to the exoergicity limit as a result of the long-range potential inhibiting the escape of products. The completeness of our measurements provides a benchmark for quantum dynamics calculations beyond the current state of the art.

Migratory birds are thought to help plants to track climate change through long-distance seed dispersal3,4. However, seeds may be consistently dispersed towards cooler or warmer latitudes depending on whether the fruiting period of a plant species coincides with northward or southward migrations. Here we assess the potential of plant communities to keep pace with climate change through long-distance seed dispersal by migratory birds. To do so, we combine phenological and migration information with data on 949 seed-dispersal interactions between 46 bird and 81 plant species from 13 woodland communities across Europe. Most of the plant species (86%) in these communities are dispersed by birds migrating south, whereas only 35% are dispersed by birds migrating north; the latter subset is phylogenetically clustered in lineages that have fruiting periods that overlap with the spring migration. Moreover, the majority of this critical dispersal service northwards is provided by only a few Palaearctic migrant species. The potential of migratory birds to assist a small, non-random sample of plants to track climate change latitudinally is expected to strongly influence the formation of novel plant communities, and thus affect their ecosystem functions and community assembly at higher trophic levels. Interactions between European bird and plant species show that fruiting period has a major effect on seed dispersal by migrating birds, which will influence plant adaptations to climate change through latitudinal dispersal.",

Although metabolic health was improved, severe calorie restriction led to a decrease in bacterial abundance and restructuring of the gut microbiome. Transplantation of post-diet microbiota to mice decreased their body weight and adiposity relative to mice that received pre-diet microbiota. Weight loss was associated with impaired nutrient absorption and enrichment in Clostridioides difficile, which was consistent with a decrease in bile acids and was sufficient to replicate metabolic phenotypes in mice in a toxin-dependent manner. These results emphasize the importance of diet–microbiome interactions in modulating host energy balance and the need to understand the role of diet in the interplay between pathogenic and beneficial symbionts. Severe caloric restriction in humans leads to reversible changes in the gut microbiota that promote weight loss and the expansion of an enteric pathogen in mice.",

The probabilistic nature of the Bayesian-deep-learning model allows to obtain principled uncertainty estimates, which are found to be correlated with crystalline order of metallic nanoparticles in electron tomography experiments. Applying unsupervised learning to the internal neural-network representations reveals grain boundaries and (unapparent) structural regions sharing easily interpretable geometrical properties.

We identify distinctly faster relaxation of charge carriers in the topologically protected Dirac surface states (few hundred femtoseconds), compared to bulk carriers (few picoseconds).

Ambitious targets have been proposed, such as reversing the declining trends in biodiversity3; however, just feeding the growing human population will make this a challenge4. Here we use an ensemble of land-use and biodiversity models to assess whether—and how—humanity can reverse the declines in terrestrial biodiversity caused by habitat conversion, which is a major threat to biodiversity5. We show that immediate efforts, consistent with the broader sustainability agenda but of unprecedented ambition and coordination, could enable the provision of food for the growing human population while reversing the global terrestrial biodiversity trends caused by habitat conversion. If we decide to increase the extent of land under conservation management, restore degraded land and generalize landscape-level conservation planning, biodiversity trends from habitat conversion could become positive by the mid-twenty-first century on average across models (confidence interval, 2042–2061), but this was not the case for all models. Food prices could increase and, on average across models, almost half (confidence interval, 34–50%) of the future biodiversity losses could not be avoided. However, additionally tackling the drivers of land-use change could avoid conflict with affordable food provision and reduces the environmental effects of the food-provision system. Through further sustainable intensification and trade, reduced food waste and more plant-based human diets, more than two thirds of future biodiversity losses are avoided and the biodiversity trends from habitat conversion are reversed by 2050 for almost all of the models. Although limiting further loss will remain challenging in several biodiversity-rich regions, and other threats—such as climate change—must be addressed to truly reverse the declines in biodiversity, our results show that ambitious conservation efforts and food system transformation are central to an effective post-2020 biodiversity strategy. To promote the recovery of the currently declining global trends in terrestrial biodiversity, increases in both the extent of land under conservation management and the sustainability of the global food system from farm to fork are required.",

This paradox is based on opposite effects of the phytohormone auxin, which promotes cell expansion in shoots while inhibiting it in roots via a yet unknown cellular mechanism2. Here, by combining microfluidics, live imaging, genetic engineering and phosphoproteomics in Arabidopsis thaliana, we advance understanding of how auxin inhibits root growth. We show that auxin activates two distinct, antagonistically acting signalling pathways that converge on rapid regulation of apoplastic pH, a causative determinant of growth. Cell surface-based TRANSMEMBRANE KINASE1 (TMK1) interacts with and mediates phosphorylation and activation of plasma membrane H+-ATPases for apoplast acidification, while intracellular canonical auxin signalling promotes net cellular H+ influx, causing apoplast alkalinization. Simultaneous activation of these two counteracting mechanisms poises roots for rapid, fine-tuned growth modulation in navigating complex soil environments. Auxin rapidly modulates root growth through simultaneous activation of two opposing mechanisms—TMK1-mediated apoplast acidification and TIR1/AFB-mediated apoplast alkalinization.",

In this Review, we examine the changes and trickle-down impacts of snow loss in the western United States (WUS). Across the WUS, snow water equivalent declines of ~25% are expected by 2050, with losses comparable with contemporary historical trends. There is less consensus on the time horizon of snow disappearance, but model projections combined with a new low-to-no snow definition suggest ~35–60 years before low-to-no snow becomes persistent if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated. Diminished and more ephemeral snowpacks that melt earlier will alter groundwater and streamflow dynamics. The direction of these changes are difficult to constrain given competing factors such as higher evapotranspiration, altered vegetation composition and changes in wildfire behaviour in a warmer world. These changes undermine conventional WUS water management practices, but through proactive implementation of soft and hard adaptation strategies, there is potential to build resilience to extreme, episodic and, eventually, persistent low-to-no snow conditions. Federal investments offer a timely opportunity to address these vulnerabilities, but they require a concerted portfolio of activities that cross historically siloed physical and disciplinary boundaries.

The majority of organic carbon is respired back to carbon dioxide in the biosphere, but a small fraction escapes remineralization and is preserved over geological timescales3. By removing reduced carbon from Earth’s surface, this sequestration process promotes atmospheric oxygen accumulation2 and carbon dioxide removal1. Two major mechanisms have been proposed to explain organic carbon preservation: selective preservation of biochemically unreactive compounds4,5 and protection resulting from interactions with a mineral matrix6,7. Although both mechanisms can operate across a range of environments and timescales, their global relative importance on 1,000-year to 100,000-year timescales remains uncertain4. Here we present a global dataset of the distributions of organic carbon activation energy and corresponding radiocarbon ages in soils, sediments and dissolved organic carbon. We find that activation energy distributions broaden over time in all mineral-containing samples. This result requires increasing bond-strength diversity, consistent with the formation of organo-mineral bonds8 but inconsistent with selective preservation. Radiocarbon ages further reveal that high-energy, mineral-bound organic carbon persists for millennia relative to low-energy, unbound organic carbon. Our results provide globally coherent evidence for the proposed7 importance of mineral protection in promoting organic carbon preservation. We suggest that similar studies of bond-strength diversity in ancient sediments may reveal how and why organic carbon preservation—and thus atmospheric composition and climate—has varied over geological time. Broadening activation energy distributions and increasing radiocarbon ages reveal the global importance of mineral protection in promoting organic carbon preservation.",

		"desc": "Arsenotrophic bacteria play an essential role in lowering arsenic contamination by converting toxic arsenite [As (III)] to less toxic and less bio-accumulative arsenate [As (V)]. The current study focused on the qualitative and electrocatalytic detection of the arsenite oxidation potential of an arsenite-oxidizing bacteria A. xylosoxidans BHW-15 (retrieved from As-contaminated tube well water), which could significantly contribute to arsenic detoxification, accumulation, and immobilization while also providing a scientific foundation for future electrochemical sensor development. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value for the bacteria was 15 mM As (III). Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) investigation validated its intracellular As uptake capacity and demonstrated a substantial association with the MIC value. During the stationary phase, the strain’s As (III) transformation efficiency was 0.0224 mM/h. Molecular analysis by real-time qPCR showed arsenite oxidase (aioA) gene expression increased 1.6-fold in the presence of As (III) compared to the untreated cells. The immobilized whole-cell also showed As (III) conversion up to 18 days. To analyze the electrochemical oxidation in water, we developed a modified GCE/P-Arg/ErGO-AuNPs electrode, which successfully sensed and quantified conversion of As (III) into As (V) by accepting electrons; implying a functional As oxidase enzyme activity in the cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the electrochemical observation of the As-transformation mechanism with Achromobacter sp. Furthermore, the current work highlighted that our isolate might be employed as a promising candidate for arsenic bioremediation, and information acquired from this study may be helpful to open a new window for the development of a cost-effective, eco-friendly biosensor for arsenic species detection in the future.",

This nutrient is transported across the blood–brain and blood–retina barriers in the form of lysophosphatidylcholine by major facilitator superfamily domain containing 2A (MFSD2A) in a Na+-dependent manner7,8. Here we present the structure of MFSD2A determined using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, which reveals twelve transmembrane helices that are separated into two pseudosymmetric domains. The transporter is in an inward-facing conformation and features a large amphipathic cavity that contains the Na+-binding site and a bound lysolipid substrate, which we confirmed using native mass spectrometry. Together with our functional analyses and molecular dynamics simulations, this structure reveals details of how MFSD2A interacts with substrates and how Na+-dependent conformational changes allow for the release of these substrates into the membrane through a lateral gate. Our work provides insights into the molecular mechanism by which this atypical major facility superfamily transporter mediates the uptake of lysolipids into the brain, and has the potential to aid in the delivery of neurotherapeutic agents. Cryo-electron microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations reveal how MFSD2A transports essential omega-3 fatty acids across the blood–brain and blood–retina barriers as lysolipids.",

Here we describe a human monoclonal antibody designated S2X259, which recognizes a highly conserved cryptic epitope of the receptor-binding domain and cross-reacts with spikes from all clades of sarbecovirus. S2X259 broadly neutralizes spike-mediated cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, including variants of concern (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and B.1.427/B.1.429), as well as a wide spectrum of human and potentially zoonotic sarbecoviruses through inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding to the receptor-binding domain. Furthermore, deep-mutational scanning and in vitro escape selection experiments demonstrate that S2X259 possesses an escape profile that is limited to a single substitution, G504D. We show that prophylactic and therapeutic administration of S2X259 protects Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) against challenge with the prototypic SARS-CoV-2 and the B.1.351 variant of concern, which suggests that this monoclonal antibody is a promising candidate for the prevention and treatment of emergent variants and zoonotic infections. Our data reveal a key antigenic site that is targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies and will guide the design of vaccines that are effective against all sarbecoviruses. The human monoclonal antibody S2X259 cross-reacts with spike proteins from all clades of sarbecovirus, and provides prophylactic and therapeutic protection in vivo against parental SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants of concern.",

For example, relativistic fermions are realized in a single layer of carbon atoms1, the quantized Hall effect can result from two-dimensional (2D) systems2,3, and the superconducting transition temperature can be considerably increased in a one-atomic-layer material4,5. Ordinarily, a 2D electronic system can be obtained by exfoliating the layered materials, growing monolayer materials on substrates, or establishing interfaces between different materials. Here we use femtosecond infrared laser pulses to invert the periodic lattice distortion sectionally in a three-dimensional (3D) charge density wave material (1T-TiSe2), creating macroscopic domain walls of transient 2D ordered electronic states with unusual properties. The corresponding ultrafast electronic and lattice dynamics are captured by time-resolved and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy6 and ultrafast electron diffraction at energies of the order of megaelectronvolts7. Moreover, in the photoinduced 2D domain wall near the surface we identify a phase with enhanced density of states and signatures of potential opening of an energy gap near the Fermi energy. Such optical modulation of atomic motion is an alternative path towards realizing 2D electronic states and will be a useful platform upon which novel phases in quantum materials may be discovered. Two-dimensional electronic states are observed at the induced domain walls of a three-dimensional charge density wave material by manipulating the periodic lattice distortion via femtosecond infrared pulses.",

Drg1 monomers contain two AAA-domains (D1 and D2) that act in a concerted manner. Rlp24 release is inhibited by the drug diazaborine which blocks ATP hydrolysis in D2. The mode of inhibition was unknown. Here we show the first cryo-EM structure of Drg1 revealing the inhibitory mechanism. Diazaborine forms a covalent bond to the 2′-OH of the nucleotide in D2, explaining its specificity for this site. As a consequence, the D2 domain is locked in a rigid, inactive state, stalling the whole Drg1 hexamer. Resistance mechanisms identified include abolished drug binding and altered positioning of the nucleotide. Our results suggest nucleotide-modifying compounds as potential novel inhibitors for AAA-ATPases. The AAA-ATPase Drg1 is a key factor in eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis that initiates cytoplasmic maturation of the large subunit. Here the authors report the structure of Drg1 in complex with its specific inhibitor diazaborine and provide insight into the mechanism of inhibition and specificity of this class of inhibitors.",

The presence of symptom clusters, regional differences in disease expression and similarities with, for example, Crohn’s disease suggest that multiple pathological pathways are involved in Behçet syndrome. These disease features also make formulating disease criteria difficult. Genetic studies have identified HLA-B*51 as a genetic risk factor. However, the low prevalence of HLA-B*51 in many patients with bona fide disease, especially in non-endemic regions, suggests that other factors must also be operative in Behçet syndrome. Despite lacking a clear aetiological mechanism and definition, management of manifestations that include major vascular disease, eye disease and central nervous system involvement has improved with the help of new technology. Furthermore, even with our incomplete understanding of disease mechanisms, the prognoses of patients with Behçet syndrome, including those with eye disease, continue to improve. New treatment options and a better understanding of the underlying pathogenesis for various manifestations of this condition are required to further improve the management of the disease, which will improve patient quality of life. Behçet syndrome is a recurrent multiorgan inflammatory disorder and a systemic vasculitis that predominantly affects veins.

Here we introduce a second wave of data from the study, comprising 1,631 new metagenomes (2,355 total) targeting diverse body sites with multiple time points in 265 individuals. We applied updated profiling and assembly methods to provide new characterizations of microbiome personalization. Strain identification revealed subspecies clades specific to body sites; it also quantified species with phylogenetic diversity under-represented in isolate genomes. Body-wide functional profiling classified pathways into universal, human-enriched, and body site-enriched subsets. Finally, temporal analysis decomposed microbial variation into rapidly variable, moderately variable, and stable subsets. This study furthers our knowledge of baseline human microbial diversity and enables an understanding of personalized microbiome function and dynamics. Updates from the Human Microbiome Project analyse the largest known body-wide metagenomic profile of human microbiome personalization. The National Institutes of Health Human Microbiome Project, published in 2012, provided a broad overview of the baseline microbiome in healthy individuals using samples from 18 different body sites. In this second installment, the authors expand this dataset with new whole-metagenome sequences and additional time points to assess the diversity and spatiotemporal distributions of the microbiota at six of these body sites. Using a combination of strain profiling, species-level metagenomic functional profiling and longitudinal analyses, this study delivers deeper insights into human microbial communities and provides an important resource for understanding what constitutes a 'healthy' microbiota.",

		"desc": "Naturally occurring protein switches have been repurposed for the development of biosensors and reporters for cellular and clinical applications1. However, the number of such switches is limited, and reengineering them is challenging. Here we show that a general class of protein-based biosensors can be created by inverting the flow of information through de novo designed protein switches in which the binding of a peptide key triggers biological outputs of interest2. The designed sensors are modular molecular devices with a closed dark state and an open luminescent state; analyte binding drives the switch from the closed to the open state. Because the sensor is based on the thermodynamic coupling of analyte binding to sensor activation, only one target binding domain is required, which simplifies sensor design and allows direct readout in solution. We create biosensors that can sensitively detect the anti-apoptosis protein BCL-2, the IgG1 Fc domain, the HER2 receptor, and Botulinum neurotoxin B, as well as biosensors for cardiac troponin I and an anti-hepatitis B virus antibody with the high sensitivity required to detect these molecules clinically. Given the need for diagnostic tools to track the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)3, we used the approach to design sensors for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and antibodies against the membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. The former, which incorporates a de novo designed spike receptor binding domain (RBD) binder4, has a limit of detection of 15 pM and a luminescence signal 50-fold higher than the background level. The modularity and sensitivity of the platform should enable the rapid construction of sensors for a wide range of analytes, and highlights the power of de novo protein design to create multi-state protein systems with new and useful functions. A modular de novo designed biosensor platform consisting of a cage and key molecule is developed, and used to create sensors for seven distinct proteins including the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 and anti-SARS antibodies.",

Here we probe the accessible chromatin in more than 800,000 individual nuclei from 45 regions that span the adult mouse isocortex, olfactory bulb, hippocampus and cerebral nuclei, and use the resulting data to map the state of 491,818 candidate cis-regulatory DNA elements in 160 distinct cell types.

We characterize the gene regulatory sequences associated with the regional specificity within these cell types. We further link a considerable fraction of the cis-regulatory elements to putative target genes expressed in diverse cerebral cell types and predict transcriptional regulators that are involved in a broad spectrum of molecular and cellular pathways in different neuronal and glial cell populations.

It is now recognized that gut microbiota are key to form adequate immune and metabolic functions and, more in general, for the maintenance of good health. Gut microbiota are established before birth under the influence of maternal nutrition and metabolic status, which can impact the future metabolic risk of the offspring in terms of obesity, diabetes, and cardiometabolic disorders during the lifespan. Obesity and diabetes are prone to disrupt the gut microbiota and alter the gut barrier permeability, leading to metabolic endotoxaemia with its detrimental consequences on health. Specific bacterial sequences are now viewed as peculiar signatures of the metabolic syndrome across life stages in each individual, and are linked to pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) via metabolic products (metabolites) and immune modulation. These mechanisms have been linked, in association with abnormalities in microbial richness and diversity, to an increased risk of developing arterial hypertension, systemic inflammation, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure. Emerging strategies for the manipulation of intestinal microbiota represent a promising therapeutic option for the prevention and treatment of CVD especially in individuals prone to CV events.",

		"desc": "Coastal wetlands (mangrove, tidal marsh and seagrass) sustain the highest rates of carbon sequestration per unit area of all natural systems1,2, primarily because of their comparatively high productivity and preservation of organic carbon within sedimentary substrates3. Climate change and associated relative sea-level rise (RSLR) have been proposed to increase the rate of organic-carbon burial in coastal wetlands in the first half of the twenty-first century4, but these carbon–climate feedback effects have been modelled to diminish over time as wetlands are increasingly submerged and carbon stores become compromised by erosion4,5. Here we show that tidal marshes on coastlines that experienced rapid RSLR over the past few millennia (in the late Holocene, from about 4,200 years ago to the present) have on average 1.7 to 3.7 times higher soil carbon concentrations within 20 centimetres of the surface than those subject to a long period of sea-level stability. This disparity increases with depth, with soil carbon concentrations reduced by a factor of 4.9 to 9.1 at depths of 50 to 100 centimetres. We analyse the response of a wetland exposed to recent rapid RSLR following subsidence associated with pillar collapse in an underlying mine and demonstrate that the gain in carbon accumulation and elevation is proportional to the accommodation space (that is, the space available for mineral and organic material accumulation) created by RSLR. Our results suggest that coastal wetlands characteristic of tectonically stable coastlines have lower carbon storage owing to a lack of accommodation space and that carbon sequestration increases according to the vertical and lateral accommodation space6 created by RSLR. Such wetlands will provide long-term mitigating feedback effects that are relevant to global climate–carbon modelling. Wetlands exposed to rapid sea-level rise over the late Holocene contain more soil carbon than those that experienced a long period of sea-level stability.",

		"desc": "Autophagy is a versatile degradation system for maintaining cellular homeostasis whereby cytosolic materials are sequestered in a double-membrane autophagosome and subsequently delivered to lysosomes, where they are broken down. In multicellular organisms, newly formed autophagosomes undergo a process called ‘maturation’, in which they fuse with vesicles originating from endolysosomal compartments, including early/late endosomes and lysosomes, to form amphisomes, which eventually become degradative autolysosomes. This fusion process requires the concerted actions of multiple regulators of membrane dynamics, including SNAREs, tethering proteins and RAB GTPases, and also transport of autophagosomes and late endosomes/lysosomes towards each other. Multiple mechanisms modulate autophagosome maturation, including post-translational modification of key components, spatial distribution of phosphoinositide lipid species on membranes, RAB protein dynamics, and biogenesis and function of lysosomes. Nutrient status and various stresses integrate into the autophagosome maturation machinery to coordinate the progression of autophagic flux. Impaired autophagosome maturation is linked to the pathogenesis of various human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, cancer and myopathies. Furthermore, invading pathogens exploit various strategies to block autophagosome maturation, thus evading destruction and even subverting autophagic vacuoles (autophagosomes, amphisomes and autolysosomes) for survival, growth and/or release. Here, we discuss the recent progress in our understanding of the machinery and regulation of autophagosome maturation, the relevance of these mechanisms to human pathophysiology and how they are harnessed by pathogens for their benefit. We also provide perspectives on targeting autophagosome maturation therapeutically. Following their biogenesis, autophagosomes undergo maturation into degradative autolysosomes by fusing with late endosomes/lysosomes. This process — involving an array of molecular regulators of membrane dynamics — is essential for autophagic degradation, and its deregulation can lead to disease, including neurodegeneration, muscle diseases and cancer, and propagation of pathogens.",

Here we create a cohesive model that unites terrestrial foods with nearly 3,000 taxa of aquatic foods to understand the future impact of aquatic foods on human nutrition. We project two plausible futures to 2030: a baseline scenario with moderate growth in aquatic animal-source food (AASF) production, and a high-production scenario with a 15-million-tonne increased supply of AASFs over the business-as-usual scenario in 2030, driven largely by investment and innovation in aquaculture production. By comparing changes in AASF consumption between the scenarios, we elucidate geographic and demographic vulnerabilities and estimate health impacts from diet-related causes. Globally, we find that a high-production scenario will decrease AASF prices by 26% and increase their consumption, thereby reducing the consumption of red and processed meats that can lead to diet-related non-communicable diseases5,6 while also preventing approximately 166 million cases of inadequate micronutrient intake. This finding provides a broad evidentiary basis for policy makers and development stakeholders to capitalize on the potential of aquatic foods to reduce food and nutrition insecurity and tackle malnutrition in all its forms. Data on the nutrient content of almost 3,000 aquatic animal-source foods is combined with a food-systems model to show that an increase in aquatic-food production could reduce the inadequate intake of most nutrients.",

In this cohort, 83% patients had S1-reactive antibodies and 82% had neutralizing antibodies against wild type SARS-CoV-2, whereas neutralizing antibody titers against the Alpha, Beta and Delta variants were substantially reduced.

By comparison LCH, ECD, RDD and JXG share some features of malignant cells including activating MAPK pathway mutations, but are not hyperproliferative. ‘Inflammatory myeloproliferative neoplasm’ may be a more precise nomenclature. By contrast, haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is associated with macrophage activation and extreme inflammation, and represents a syndrome of immune dysregulation. These diseases affect children and adults in varying proportions depending on which of the entities is involved. Histiocytic disorders are characterized by proliferation of cells with macrophage or dendritic cell phenotype and intense inflammation. Clinical signs and symptoms depend on the specific disease and the tissues and organs affected.",

		"desc": "A major challenge facing climate scientists is explaining to non-specialists the risks and uncertainties surrounding potential changes over the coming years, decades and centuries. Although there are many guidelines for climate communication, there is little empirical evidence of their efficacy, whether for dispassionately explaining the science or for persuading people to act in more sustainable ways. Moreover, climate communication faces new challenges as assessments of climate-related changes confront uncertainty more explicitly and adopt risk-based approaches to evaluating impacts. Given its critical importance, public understanding of climate science deserves the strongest possible communications science to convey the practical implications of large, complex, uncertain physical, biological and social processes. Here, we identify the communications science that is needed to meet this challenge and the ambitious, interdisciplinary initiative that its effective application to climate science requires. Explaining climate risks and uncertainties to non-specialists is fraught with difficulties. An array of principles and guidelines has been developed to aid this process, but there is little evidence for their efficacy. An empirical approach is thus needed to identify the communications approaches that will effectively convey the practical implications of large, complex, uncertain physical, biological and social processes. An ambitious interdisciplinary initiative will be required to deliver effective climate science communication, including institutional support to sustain it.",

The only foundation that can exist for such an opinion is that carbon monoxide is one of the most virulent gaseous poisons known, and that less than 1 per cent, in air rapidly proves fatal, but inasmuch as all the explosives in general, use produce it in large quantities, the smokeless powders in use by England France, and Germany, giving approximately 50 per cent of the permanent gases formed as carbon monoxide, it is hard to believe that the enormous volume produced by firing the charge in the gun should have no deleterious effect on. those using it, whilst the much smaller quantity given on the bursting of the shell should asphyxiate the enemy. The fact is, that carbon monoxide is slightly lighter than air, and when driven out by the explosion in a heated condition diffuses upwards so rapidly that scarcely a trace can be found at the breathing level, but when evolved underground in a confined space many accidents have been caused by its poisonous properties.",

		"desc": "Time-restricted feeding (TRF) has recently gained interest as a potential anti-ageing treatment for organisms from Drosophila to humans1–5. TRF restricts food intake to specific hours of the day. Because TRF controls the timing of feeding, rather than nutrient or caloric content, TRF has been hypothesized to depend on circadian-regulated functions; the underlying molecular mechanisms of its effects remain unclear. Here, to exploit the genetic tools and well-characterized ageing markers of Drosophila, we developed an intermittent TRF (iTRF) dietary regimen that robustly extended fly lifespan and delayed the onset of ageing markers in the muscles and gut. We found that iTRF enhanced circadian-regulated transcription and that iTRF-mediated lifespan extension required both circadian regulation and autophagy, a conserved longevity pathway. Night-specific induction of autophagy was both necessary and sufficient to extend lifespan on an ad libitum diet and also prevented further iTRF-mediated lifespan extension. By contrast, day-specific induction of autophagy did not extend lifespan. Thus, these results identify circadian-regulated autophagy as a critical contributor to iTRF-mediated health benefits in Drosophila. Because both circadian regulation and autophagy are highly conserved processes in human ageing, this work highlights the possibility that behavioural or pharmaceutical interventions that stimulate circadian-regulated autophagy might provide people with similar health benefits, such as delayed ageing and lifespan extension. Circadian-regulated autophagy contributes to the health benefits of intermittent time-restricted feeding in Drosophila.",

The potential causal link between periodontitis and its comorbidities is further strengthened by recent experimental animal studies establishing biologically plausible and clinically consistent mechanisms whereby periodontitis could initiate or aggravate a comorbid condition. This multi-faceted ‘mechanistic causality’ aspect of the link between periodontitis and comorbidities is the focus of this Review. Understanding how certain extra-oral pathologies are affected by disseminated periodontal pathogens and periodontitis-associated systemic inflammation, including adaptation of bone marrow haematopoietic progenitors, may provide new therapeutic options to reduce the risk of periodontitis-associated comorbidities. Periodontitis has been causally linked to the development of other chronic inflammatory diseases outside the oral mucosa.

Here, we show that visible-light-driven, catalytic water oxidation can be used for in situ generation of H2O2 from water, rendering the peroxygenase catalytically active. In this way, the stereoselective oxyfunctionalization of hydrocarbons can be achieved by simply using the catalytic system, water and visible light. Peroxygenases can selectively functionalize organic compounds, but are sensitive to the co-substrate H2O2. Hollmann and co-workers show that water oxidation catalysts can provide a controlled supply of H2O2 to the enzyme in the presence of visible light, allowing efficient oxyfunctionalization without stoichiometric reductants. \n                \n                  \n                    \n                  \n                \n              ",

Intermittent clearance of p21high cells improved physical function in 23-month-old mice. Our report demonstrates that the p21-Cre mouse model is a valuable and powerful tool for studying p21high cells to further understand the biology of senescent cells.

Here we identify 290 genetic determinants of ovarian ageing, assessed using normal variation in age at natural menopause (ANM) in about 200,000 women of European ancestry. These common alleles were associated with clinical extremes of ANM; women in the top 1% of genetic susceptibility have an equivalent risk of premature ovarian insufficiency to those carrying monogenic FMR1 premutations3. The identified loci implicate a broad range of DNA damage response (DDR) processes and include loss-of-function variants in key DDR-associated genes. Integration with experimental models demonstrates that these DDR processes act across the life-course to shape the ovarian reserve and its rate of depletion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that experimental manipulation of DDR pathways highlighted by human genetics increases fertility and extends reproductive life in mice. Causal inference analyses using the identified genetic variants indicate that extending reproductive life in women improves bone health and reduces risk of type 2 diabetes, but increases the risk of hormone-sensitive cancers. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms that govern ovarian ageing, when they act, and how they might be targeted by therapeutic approaches to extend fertility and prevent disease. Hundreds of genetic loci associated with age at menopause, combined with experimental evidence in mice, highlight mechanisms of reproductive ageing across the lifespan.",

Here we describe structural changes in cerebral small vessels of patients with COVID-19 and elucidate potential mechanisms underlying the vascular pathology. In brains of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected individuals and animal models, we found an increased number of empty basement membrane tubes, so-called string vessels representing remnants of lost capillaries. We obtained evidence that brain endothelial cells are infected and that the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro) cleaves NEMO, the essential modulator of nuclear factor-κB. By ablating NEMO, Mpro induces the death of human brain endothelial cells and the occurrence of string vessels in mice. Deletion of receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK) 3, a mediator of regulated cell death, blocks the vessel rarefaction and disruption of the blood–brain barrier due to NEMO ablation. Importantly, a pharmacological inhibitor of RIPK signaling prevented the Mpro-induced microvascular pathology. Our data suggest RIPK as a potential therapeutic target to treat the neuropathology of COVID-19. A novel study led by scientists in Lübeck, Germany, shows that SARS-CoV-2-infected brain endothelial cells undergo cell death due to the cleavage of NEMO by the viral protease Mpro, potentially causing cerebral COVID-19 and ‘long COVID’ symptoms.",

Here we show that gate-tuned van Hove singularities in rhombohedral trilayer graphene6 drive spontaneous ferromagnetic polarization of the electron system into one or more spin and valley flavours. Using capacitance and transport measurements, we observe a cascade of transitions tuned to the density and electronic displacement field between phases in which quantum oscillations have fourfold, twofold or onefold degeneracy, associated with a spin- and valley-degenerate normal metal, spin-polarized ‘half-metal’, and spin- and valley-polarized ‘quarter-metal’, respectively. For electron doping, the salient features of the data are well captured by a phenomenological Stoner model7 that includes valley-anisotropic interactions. For hole filling, we observe a richer phase diagram featuring a delicate interplay of broken symmetries and transitions in the Fermi surface topology. Finally, we introduce a moiré superlattice using a rotationally aligned hexagonal boron nitride substrate5,8. Remarkably, we find that the isospin order is only weakly perturbed, with the moiré potential catalysing the formation of topologically nontrivial gapped states whenever itinerant half- or quarter-metal states occur at half- or quarter-superlattice band filling.

However, this view does not account for the established role of diet, exercise and small molecules that target the pace of metabolic ageing9–12. Here we show that metabolic alterations that occur with age can produce a systemic environment that favours the progression and aggressiveness of tumours. Specifically, we show that methylmalonic acid (MMA), a by-product of propionate metabolism, is upregulated in the serum of older people and functions as a mediator of tumour progression. We traced this to the ability of MMA to induce SOX4 expression and consequently to elicit transcriptional reprogramming that can endow cancer cells with aggressive properties. Thus, the accumulation of MMA represents a link between ageing and cancer progression, suggesting that MMA is a promising therapeutic target for advanced carcinomas. Ageing in humans is associated with an increase in circulating methylmalonic acid, which induces expression of SOX4 and promotes tumour progression.",

Here we solved the structure of a non-peptide agonist, TT-OAD2, bound to the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor. Our structure identified an unpredicted non-peptide agonist-binding pocket in which reorganization of extracellular loop 3 and transmembrane helices 6 and 7 manifests independently of direct ligand interaction within the deep transmembrane domain pocket. TT-OAD2 exhibits biased agonism, and kinetics of G-protein activation and signalling that are distinct from peptide agonists. Within the structure, TT-OAD2 protrudes beyond the receptor core to interact with the lipid or detergent, providing an explanation for the distinct activation kinetics that may contribute to the clinical efficacy of this compound series. This work alters our understanding of the events that drive the activation of class B receptors. The structure of GLP-1R and its G protein in complex with the small molecule TT-OAD2 sheds light on how the TT-OAD2 agonist can activate the receptor and provides insights into the development of therapeutic agents for metabolic disorders.",

Eighty per cent of the human genome now has at least one biochemical function assigned to it. In addition to expanding our understanding of how gene expression is regulated on a genome-wide scale, the newly identified functional elements should help researchers to interpret the results of genome-wide associated studies because many correspond to sites associated with human disease. This paper describes the first extensive map of human DNaseI hypersensitive sites — markers of regulatory DNA — in 125 diverse cell and tissue types. Integration of this information with other data sets generated by ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) identified new relationships between chromatin accessibility, transcription, DNA methylation and regulatory-factor occupancy patterns. Evolutionary-conservation analysis revealed signatures of recent functional constraint within DNaseI hypersensitive sites. DNaseI footprinting detects DNA sequences that are protected from cleavage by DNaseI because they are bound by regulatory factors. Studying these footprints in 41 diverse cell and tissue types, the authors describe millions of short sequence elements that are conserved recognition sequences for DNA-binding proteins. The effort nearly doubles the size of the human cis-regulatory lexicon and provides insight into chromatin states and levels of evolutionary conservation. A large collection of novel regulatory-factor recognition motifs that closely parallel major regulators of development, differentiation and pluripotency is also described. This manuscript describes the effort of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) Consortium to examine the principles of human transcriptional regulatory networks, using a subset of 119 transcription factors. The results are integrated with other genomic information to form a multi-level meta-network in which different levels have distinct properties. The findings will aid future interpretations of human genomics and help us to understand the basic principles of human biology and disease. These authors describe the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) effort to provide a complete catalogue of primary and processed RNAs found either in specific sub-cellular compartments or throughout the cell. They show that three-quarters of the human genome can be transcribed, and provide a wealth of information about the range and levels of expression, localization, processing fates and modifications of both known and previously unannotated RNAs. Collectively, these observations suggest that the current concept of a gene should be revisited. In this ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) manuscript, the authors use chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C2) to look at the relationships between functional elements and distal target genes in 1% of the human genome in three dimensions. They describe numerous long-range interactions between promoters and distal sites that include elements resembling enhancers, promoters and CTCF-bound sites, their genomic distribution and complex interactions. Because only ∼7% of looping interactions are with the nearest gene, genomic proximity is not a simple predictor for long-range interactions.",

This dependence can be exploited for catalyst design4,6–8, and the use of core–shell structures and elastic substrates has resulted in strain-engineered Pt catalysts with drastically improved electrocatalytic performances7,9–13. However, it is challenging to map in detail the strain–activity correlations in Pt-catalysed conversions, which can involve a number of distinct processes, and to identify the optimal strain modification for specific reactions. Here we show that when ultrathin Pt shells are deposited on palladium-based nanocubes, expansion and shrinkage of the nanocubes through phosphorization and dephosphorization induces strain in the Pt(100) lattice that can be adjusted from −5.1 per cent to 5.9 per cent. We use this strain control to tune the electrocatalytic activity of the Pt shells over a wide range, finding that the strain–activity correlation for the methanol oxidation reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction follows an M-shaped curve and a volcano-shaped curve, respectively. We anticipate that our approach can be used to screen out lattice strain that will optimize the performance of Pt catalysts—and potentially other metal catalysts—for a wide range of reactions. By depositing platinum shells on palladium-based nanocubes, the strain can be controlled by through phosphorization and dephosphorization, making it possible to tune the electrocatalytic activity of the platinum shells.",

Here we combine the traits that define both functional spaces. Our analysis confirms the major trends of the GSPFF and shows that the RES captures additional information. The four dimensions needed to explain the non-redundant information in the dataset can be summarized in an aboveground and a fine-root plane, corresponding to the GSPFF and the RES, respectively. Both planes display high levels of species aggregation, but the differentiation among growth forms, families and biomes is lower on the fine-root plane, which does not include any size-related trait, than on the aboveground plane. As a result, many species with similar fine-root syndromes display contrasting aboveground traits. This highlights the importance of including belowground organs to the GSPFF when exploring the interplay between different natural selection pressures and whole-plant trait integration.

However, there are usually some imperfections present in the resulting films: grain boundaries, regions with additional layers (adlayers), and wrinkles or folds, all of which can degrade the performance of graphene in various applications2–7. There have been numerous studies on ways to eliminate grain boundaries8,9 and adlayers10–12, but graphene folds have been less investigated. Here we explore the wrinkling/folding process for graphene films grown from an ethylene precursor on single-crystal Cu–Ni(111) foils. We identify a critical growth temperature (1,030 kelvin) above which folds will naturally form during the subsequent cooling process. Specifically, the compressive stress that builds up owing to thermal contraction during cooling is released by the abrupt onset of step bunching in the foil at about 1,030 kelvin, triggering the formation of graphene folds perpendicular to the step edge direction. By restricting the initial growth temperature to between 1,000 kelvin and 1,030 kelvin, we can produce large areas of single-crystal monolayer graphene films that are high-quality and fold-free. The resulting films show highly uniform transport properties: field-effect transistors prepared from these films exhibit average room-temperature carrier mobilities of around (7.0 ± 1.0) × 103 centimetres squared per volt per second for both holes and electrons. The process is also scalable, permitting simultaneous growth of graphene of the same quality on multiple foils stacked in parallel. After electrochemical transfer of the graphene films from the foils, the foils themselves can be reused essentially indefinitely for further graphene growth. Restricting the initial growth temperatures used for chemical vapour deposition of graphene on metal foils produces optimum conditions for growing large areas of fold-free, single-crystal graphene.",

While a limited number of nanomedicine therapies have resulted, the disappointing news is that major obstacles were overlooked in the nanoparticle’s journey. However, some of these challenges may be turned into opportunities. Here, we discuss biological barriers to cancer nanomedicines and elaborate on two directions that the field is currently exploring to meet its initial expectations. The first strategy entails re-engineering cancer nanomedicines to prevent undesired interactions en route to the tumour. The second aims instead to leverage these obstacles into out-of-the-box diagnostic and therapeutic applications of nanomedicines, for cancer and beyond. Both paths require, among other developments, a deeper understanding of nano–bio interactions. We offer a forward look at how classic cancer nanomedicine may overcome its limitations while contributing to other areas of research. This Perspective discusses biological barriers that have limited clinical translation of cancer nanomedicines and elaborates on new directions for the field that capitalize on a deeper understanding of the nano–bio interface.",

Epigenetic mechanisms involving microRNAs that lead to dysregulated gene expression may mediate the effects of obesity and weight loss on CRC risk. We examined the effects of obesity and weight loss following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on microRNA expression in the human rectal mucosa. We collected rectal mucosal biopsies from obese patients (n = 22) listed for RYGB and age- and sex-matched healthy non-obese Controls (n = 20), at baseline and six months post-surgery. We quantified microRNA expression in rectal mucosal biopsies using Next Generation Sequencing and bioinformatics analysis to investigate the likely functional consequences of these epigenetic changes. Compared with non-obese individuals, obese individuals showed differential expression of 112 microRNAs (p < 0.05). At six-months post-RYGB, when mean body mass had fallen by 27 kg, 60 microRNAs were differentially expressed, compared with baseline (p < 0.05). The expression of 36 microRNAs differed significantly between both i) obese and non-obese individuals and ii) obese individuals pre- and post-RYGB. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) demonstrated that expression of miR-31 and miR-215 was significantly (p < 0.05) higher, 143-fold and 15-fold respectively, in obese than in non-obese individuals. Weight loss, following RYGB, reduced expression of miR-31 and miR-215 to levels comparable with Controls. These differentially expressed microRNAs are implicated in pathways linked with inflammation, obesity and cancer. Our findings show, for the first time, that obesity is associated with dysregulated microRNA expression in the human rectal mucosa. Further, surgically-induced weight loss may normalise microRNA expression in this tissue.",

Recent work suggests that westerly wind belts are migrating polewards in response to anthropogenic forcing4,5. Reconstructing the westerlies during past warm periods such as the Pliocene epoch, in which atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) was about 350 to 450 parts per million6 and temperatures were about 2 to 4 degrees Celsius higher than today7, can improve our understanding of changes in the position and strength of these wind systems as the climate continues to warm. Here we show that the westerlies were weaker and more poleward during the warm Pliocene than during glacial periods after the intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation (iNHG), which occurred around 2.73 million years ago8. Our results, which are based on dust and export productivity reconstructions, indicate that major ice sheet development during the iNHG was accompanied by substantial increases in dust fluxes in the mid-latitude North Pacific Ocean, especially compared to those in the subarctic North Pacific. Following this shift, changes in dust and productivity largely track the glacial–interglacial cycles of the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene epochs. On the basis of this pattern, we infer that shifts in the westerlies were primarily driven by variations in Plio-Pleistocene thermal gradients and ice volume. By combining this relationship with other dust records9–11 and climate modelling results12, we find that the proposed changes in the westerlies were globally synchronous. If the Pliocene is predictive of future warming, we posit that continued poleward movement and weakening of the present-day westerlies in both hemispheres can be expected. Analysis of dust from marine sediments in the North Pacific shows that warm periods during the Pliocene witnessed weaker and more poleward westerlies than during subsequent glacial periods.",

		"desc": "Accurate control of gene expression is essential for normal development and dysregulation of transcription underpins cancer onset and progression. Similar to cell cycle regulation, RNA polymerase II-driven transcription can be considered as a unidirectional multistep cycle, with thousands of unique transcription cycles occurring in concert within each cell. Each transcription cycle comprises recruitment, initiation, pausing, elongation, termination and recycling stages that are tightly controlled by the coordinated action of transcriptional cyclin-dependent kinases and their cognate cyclins as well as the opposing activity of transcriptional phosphatases. Oncogenic dysregulation of transcription can entail defective control of gene expression, either at select loci or more globally, impacting a large proportion of the genome. The resultant dependency on the core-transcriptional machinery is believed to render ‘transcriptionally addicted’ cancers sensitive to perturbation of transcription. Based on these findings, small molecules targeting transcriptional cyclin-dependent kinases and associated proteins hold promise for the treatment of cancer. Here, we utilize the transcription cycles concept to explain how dysregulation of these finely tuned gene expression processes may drive tumorigenesis and how therapeutically beneficial responses may arise from global or selective transcriptional perturbation. This conceptual framework helps to explain tumour-selective transcriptional dependencies and facilitates the rational design of combination therapies. This Review discusses the concept of transcription cycles in cancer, providing a framework for our understanding of dysregulated transcription in cancer and therapeutic targeting of dysregulated transcription cycles.",

Here, we apply an integrated genomic approach to a murine allelic series that models the two most common mutations in AML: Flt3-ITD and Npm1c. We then deconvolute the contribution of each mutation to alterations of the epigenetic landscape and genome organization, and infer how mutations synergize in the induction of AML. Our studies demonstrate that Flt3-ITD signals to chromatin to alter the epigenetic environment and synergizes with mutations in Npm1c to alter gene expression and drive leukemia induction. These analyses also allow the identification of long-range cis-regulatory circuits, including a previously unknown superenhancer of Hoxa locus, as well as larger and more detailed gene-regulatory networks, driven by transcription factors including PU.1 and IRF8, whose importance we demonstrate through perturbation of network members. Mice bearing mutations in Flt3-ITD and Npm1c, which are commonly found in acute myeloid leukemia, are used to characterize the cooperative effects of these cancer drivers on the cellular epigenome and three-dimensional genome conformation during tumor development.",

CPA has been exploited to create nanomaterials with unusual properties4–6 and is implicated in the development of complex mineral textures1,7. Oriented attachment7,8—a form of CPA in which particles align along specific crystallographic directions—produces mesocrystals that diffract as single crystals do, although the constituent particles are still discernible2,9. The conventional view of CPA is that nucleation provides a supply of particles that aggregate via Brownian motion biased by attractive interparticle potentials1,9–12. However, mesocrystals often exhibit regular morphologies and uniform sizes. Although many crystal systems form mesocrystals1–9 and individual attachment events have been directly visualized10, how random attachment events lead to well defined, self-similar morphologies remains unknown, as does the role of surface-bound ligands, which are ubiquitous in nanoparticle systems3,9,11. Attempts to understand mesocrystal formation are further complicated in many systems by the presence of precursor nanoparticles with a phase distinct from that of the bulk1,13,14. Some studies propose that such particles convert before attachment15, whereas others attribute conversion to the attachment process itself16 and yet others conclude that transformation occurs after the mesocrystals exceed a characteristic size14,17. Here we investigate mesocrystal formation by iron oxides, which are important colloidal phases in natural environments18,19 and classic examples of systems forming ubiquitous precursor phases and undergoing CPA accompanied by phase transformations15,19–21. Combining in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at 80 degrees Celsius with ‘freeze-and-look’ TEM, we tracked the formation of haematite (Hm) mesocrystals in the presence of oxalate (Ox), which is abundant in soils, where iron oxides are common. We find that isolated Hm particles rarely appear, but once formed, interfacial gradients at the Ox-covered surfaces drive Hm particles to nucleate repeatedly about two nanometres from the surfaces, to which they then attach, thereby generating mesocrystals. Comparison to natural and synthetic systems suggests that interface-driven pathways are widespread. Mesocrystal formation is investigated for haematite in the presence of oxalate, showing that chemical gradients at interfaces cause nucleation near surfaces rather than in the bulk, followed by particle attachment.",

Although the segregation of RNA into phase-separated condensates broadly affects RNA metabolism3,4, whether and how specific RNAs use phase separation to regulate interacting factors such as RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), and the phenotypic consequences of such regulatory interactions, are poorly understood. Here we show that RNA-driven phase separation is a key mechanism through which a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) controls the activity of RBPs and maintains genomic stability in mammalian cells. The lncRNA NORAD prevents aberrant mitosis by inhibiting Pumilio (PUM) proteins5–8. We show that NORAD can out-compete thousands of other PUM-binding transcripts to inhibit PUM by nucleating the formation of phase-separated PUM condensates, termed NP bodies. Dual mechanisms of PUM recruitment, involving multivalent PUM–NORAD and PUM–PUM interactions, enable NORAD to competitively sequester a super-stoichiometric amount of PUM in NP bodies. Disruption of NORAD-driven PUM phase separation leads to PUM hyperactivity and genome instability that is rescued by synthetic RNAs that induce the formation of PUM condensates. These results reveal a mechanism by which RNA-driven phase separation can regulate RBP activity and identify an essential role for this process in genome maintenance. The repetitive sequence architecture of NORAD and other lncRNAs9–11 suggests that phase separation may be a widely used mechanism of lncRNA-mediated regulation. The noncoding RNA NORAD maintains genome stability in mammalian cells by sequestering Pumilio proteins in phase-separated compartments.",

Comparative genomic analysis suggests that the loquat genome has evolved a unique genetic mechanism of chromosome repair. Resequencing data from 52 loquat cultivars, including 16 white-fleshed and 36 yellow-fleshed variants, were analyzed, and the flower, leaf, and root metabolomes of ‘Big Five-pointed Star’ were determined using a UPLC-ESI-MS/M system.

Candidate genes related to the biosynthesis of various medicinal ingredients, such as phenolics, flavonoids, terpenoids, and polysaccharides, were identified. Some of these genes were confirmed to be members of expanding gene families, suggesting that the high concentrations of beneficial metabolites in loquat may be associated with the number of biosynthetic genes in this plant.

Chronic, low-grade inflammation is recognized as a major pathogenic mechanism that underlies the association between CKD and obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and diabetes, through interaction between resident and/or circulating immune cells with parenchymal cells. Thus, considerable interest exists in approaches that target inflammation as a strategy to manage CKD. The initial phase of the inflammatory response to injury or metabolic dysfunction reflects the release of pro-inflammatory mediators including peptides, lipids and cytokines, and the recruitment of leukocytes. In self-limiting inflammation, the evolving inflammatory response is coupled to distinct processes that promote the resolution of inflammation and restore homeostasis. The discovery of endogenously generated lipid mediators — specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators and branched fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids — which promote the resolution of inflammation and attenuate the microvascular and macrovascular complications of obesity and diabetes mellitus highlights novel opportunities for potential therapeutic intervention through the targeting of pro-resolution, rather than anti-inflammatory pathways. Inflammation is a known driver of diabetes and obesity-associated kidney disease. This Review describes the role of endogenous lipid mediators — specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators and branched fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids — in the resolution of inflammation and explores how insights into their function could identify new targets for therapeutic intervention. \n                \n                  \n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    \n                  \n                \n              ",

Organoid technology enables an efficient expansion of intestinal epithelium tissue in vitro1, but reconstruction of the whole small intestine, including the complex lymphovascular system, has remained challenging2. Here we generate a functional small intestinalized colon (SIC) by replacing the native colonic epithelium with ileum-derived organoids. We first find that xenotransplanted human ileum organoids maintain their regional identity and form nascent villus structures in the mouse colon. In vitro culture of an organoid monolayer further reveals an essential role for luminal mechanistic flow in the formation of villi. We then develop a rat SIC model by repositioning the SIC at the ileocaecal junction, where the epithelium is exposed to a constant luminal stream of intestinal juice. This anatomical relocation provides the SIC with organ structures of the small intestine, including intact vasculature and innervation, villous structures, and the lacteal (a fat-absorbing lymphatic structure specific to the small intestine). The SIC has absorptive functions and markedly ameliorates intestinal failure in a rat model of SBS, whereas transplantation of colon organoids instead of ileum organoids invariably leads to mortality. These data provide a proof of principle for the use of intestinal organoids for regenerative purposes, and offer a feasible strategy for SBS treatment. In a rat model of short bowel syndrome, transplantation of small intestinal organoids into the colon partially restores intestinal function and improves survival—a proof of principle that organoid transplantation might have therapeutic benefit.",

Here we report that the stress hormone corticosterone—which is derived from the adrenal gland and is the rodent equivalent of cortisol in humans—regulates hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) quiescence and hair growth in mice. In the absence of systemic corticosterone, HFSCs enter substantially more rounds of the regeneration cycle throughout life. Conversely, under chronic stress, increased levels of corticosterone prolong HFSC quiescence and maintain hair follicles in an extended resting phase. Mechanistically, corticosterone acts on the dermal papillae to suppress the expression of Gas6, a gene that encodes the secreted factor growth arrest specific 6. Restoring Gas6 expression overcomes the stress-induced inhibition of HFSC activation and hair growth. Our work identifies corticosterone as a systemic inhibitor of HFSC activity through its effect on the niche, and demonstrates that the removal of such inhibition drives HFSCs into frequent regeneration cycles, with no observable defects in the long-term. Stress inhibits  hair growth in mice through the release of the stress hormone corticosterone from the adrenal glands, which inhibits the activation of hair follicle stem cells by suppressing the expression of a secreted factor, GAS6, from the dermal niche.",

For the pancreas, however, mechanisms underlying cellular renewal and initiation of PDAC remain unresolved. Here, using lineage tracing from the endogenous telomerase reverse transcriptase (Tert) locus, we identify a rare TERT-positive subpopulation of pancreatic acinar cells dispersed throughout the exocrine compartment. During homeostasis, these TERThigh acinar cells renew the pancreas by forming expanding clones of acinar cells, whereas randomly marked acinar cells do not form these clones. Specific expression of mutant Kras in TERThigh acinar cells accelerates acinar clone formation and causes transdifferentiation to ductal pre-invasive pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms by upregulating Ras–MAPK signalling and activating the downstream kinase ERK (phospho-ERK). In resected human pancreatic neoplasms, we find that foci of phospho-ERK-positive acinar cells are common and frequently contain activating KRAS mutations, suggesting that these acinar regions represent an early cancer precursor lesion. These data support a model in which rare TERThigh acinar cells may sustain KRAS mutations, driving acinar cell expansion and creating a field of aberrant cells initiating pancreatic tumorigenesis. A rare population of acinar cells expressing telomerase reverse transcriptase renew the acinar cell compartment during homeostasis, and are potential sources of premalignant cells in pancreatic carcinogenesis.",

We found that the precursors of different epithelial lineages were aligned in a 2D concentric manner in the basal layer of the hair placode.

Branched flow may act as a trigger for the formation of extreme nonlinear events14–17 and as a channel through which energy is transmitted in a scattering medium18. Here we present the experimental observation of the branched flow of light. We show that, as light propagates inside a thin soap membrane, smooth thickness variations in the film act as a correlated disordered potential, focusing the light into filaments that display the features of branched flow: scaling of the distance to the first branching point and the probability distribution of the intensity. We find that, counterintuitively, despite the random variations in the medium and the linear nature of the effect, the filaments remain collimated throughout their paths. Bringing branched flow to the field of optics, with its full arsenal of tools, opens the door to the investigation of a plethora of new ideas such as branched flow in nonlinear media, in curved space or in active systems with gain. Furthermore, the labile nature of soap films leads to a regime in which the branched flow of light interacts and affects the underlying disorder through radiation pressure and gradient force. Branched flow of light is experimentally observed inside a thin soap membrane, where smooth variations of the membrane thickness transform the light beam into branched filaments of enhanced intensity that keep dividing as the waves propagate.",

Here we describe GS-6207, a small molecule that disrupts the functions of HIV capsid protein and is amenable to long-acting therapy owing to its high potency, low in vivo systemic clearance and slow release kinetics from the subcutaneous injection site. Drawing on X-ray crystallographic information, we designed GS-6207 to bind tightly at a conserved interface between capsid protein monomers, where it interferes with capsid-protein-mediated interactions between proteins that are essential for multiple phases of the viral replication cycle. GS-6207 exhibits antiviral activity at picomolar concentrations against all subtypes of HIV-1 that we tested, and shows high synergy and no cross-resistance with approved antiretroviral drugs. In phase-1 clinical studies, monotherapy with a single subcutaneous dose of GS-6207 (450 mg) resulted in a mean log10-transformed reduction of plasma viral load of 2.2 after 9 days, and showed sustained plasma exposure at antivirally active concentrations for more than 6 months. These results provide clinical validation for therapies that target the functions of HIV capsid protein, and demonstrate the potential of GS-6207 as a long-acting agent to treat or prevent infection with HIV. The small molecule GS-6207, which disrupts the function of the HIV capsid protein, shows potential as a long-acting therapeutic agent for the treatment and prevention of HIV infection.",

		"desc": "There is an urgent need to create novel models using human disease-relevant cells to study severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) biology and to facilitate drug screening. Here, as SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract, we developed a lung organoid model using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-LOs). The hPSC-LOs (particularly alveolar type-II-like cells) are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and showed robust induction of chemokines following SARS-CoV-2 infection, similar to what is seen in patients with COVID-19. Nearly 25% of these patients also have gastrointestinal manifestations, which are associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes1. We therefore also generated complementary hPSC-derived colonic organoids (hPSC-COs) to explore the response of colonic cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that multiple colonic cell types, especially enterocytes, express ACE2 and are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using hPSC-LOs, we performed a high-throughput screen of drugs approved by the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) and identified entry inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2, including imatinib, mycophenolic acid and quinacrine dihydrochloride. Treatment at physiologically relevant levels of these drugs significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of both hPSC-LOs and hPSC-COs. Together, these data demonstrate that hPSC-LOs and hPSC-COs infected by SARS-CoV-2 can serve as disease models to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide a valuable resource for drug screening to identify candidate COVID-19 therapeutics. The use of lung and colonic organoid systems to assess the susceptibility of lung and gut cells to SARS-CoV-2 and to screen FDA-approved drugs that have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 is demonstrated.",

		"desc": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have essential functions during embryonic development, and their dysregulation causes cancer1,2. Altered global miRNA abundance is found in different tissues and tumours, which implies that precise control of miRNA dosage is important1,3,4, but the underlying mechanism(s) of this control remain unknown. The protein complex Microprocessor, which comprises one DROSHA and two DGCR8 proteins, is essential for miRNA biogenesis5–7. Here we identify a developmentally regulated miRNA dosage control mechanism that involves alternative transcription initiation (ATI) of DGCR8. ATI occurs downstream of a stem-loop in DGCR8 mRNA to bypass an autoregulatory feedback loop during mouse embryonic stem (mES) cell differentiation. Deletion of the stem-loop causes imbalanced DGCR8:DROSHA protein stoichiometry that drives irreversible Microprocessor aggregation, reduced primary miRNA processing, decreased mature miRNA abundance, and widespread de-repression of lipid metabolic mRNA targets. Although global miRNA dosage control is not essential for mES cells to exit from pluripotency, its dysregulation alters lipid metabolic pathways and interferes with embryonic development by disrupting germ layer specification in vitro and in vivo. This miRNA dosage control mechanism is conserved in humans. Our results identify a promoter switch that balances Microprocessor autoregulation and aggregation to precisely control global miRNA dosage and govern stem cell fate decisions during early embryonic development. The levels of microRNAs in mouse and human cells control lipid metabolism and germ cell specification during development.",

Cells of the tail bud and the posterior presomitic mesoderm, which control posterior elongation1, exhibit a high level of aerobic glycolysis that is reminiscent of the metabolic status of cancer cells experiencing the Warburg effect2,3. Glycolytic activity downstream of fibroblast growth factor controls WNT signalling in the tail bud3. In the neuromesodermal precursors of the tail bud4, WNT signalling promotes the mesodermal fate that is required for sustained axial elongation, at the expense of the neural fate3,5. How glycolysis regulates WNT signalling in the tail bud is currently unknown. Here we used chicken embryos and human tail bud-like cells differentiated in vitro from induced pluripotent stem cells to show that these cells exhibit an inverted pH gradient, with the extracellular pH lower than the intracellular pH, as observed in cancer cells6. Our data suggest that glycolysis increases extrusion of lactate coupled to protons via the monocarboxylate symporters. This contributes to elevating the intracellular pH in these cells, which creates a favourable chemical environment for non-enzymatic β-catenin acetylation downstream of WNT signalling. As acetylated β-catenin promotes mesodermal rather than neural fate7, this ultimately leads to activation of mesodermal transcriptional WNT targets and specification of the paraxial mesoderm in tail bud precursors. Our work supports the notion that some tumour cells reactivate a developmental metabolic programme. The authors show that metabolic activity leads to an increase in the intracellular pH of neuromesodermal precursors, and that this increase in pH, by allowing post-translational modification of β-catenin, is required for the activation of WNT signalling and mesodermal fate acquisition.",

Prof. Nordenskjöld's feat is one of the finest instances of scientific prediction based on ascertained data that we know of, and we would recommend it to Sir William Harcourt's consideration when he contemplates taking part in another political “agitation.” Sir William has succeeded in getting such a firm grasp of the real nature of scientific method, and he applied it so wittily and so well in his recent Birmingham address that we would advise him to follow out this line in real earnest. So thoroughly does he seem to understand the method of scientific research and scientific prediction, and so ably, although only in sport and to banter his opponents, did he expound it, that we think science has lost in him a successful worker. To this loss we could resign ourselves if Sir William would set himself to rescue politics from its present degraded position as a mere theatre for party strife, and to elevate it into something like a science of national life and progress. He must have taken considerable pains to obtain his knowledge of the method and uses of the Nautical Almanac; his natural mistake as to its editorship we can overlook.

		"title": "SMN and symmetric arginine dimethylation of RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain control termination",
		"desc": "The carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) subunit POLR2A is a platform for modifications specifying the recruitment of factors that regulate transcription, mRNA processing, and chromatin remodelling. Here we show that a CTD arginine residue (R1810 in human) that is conserved across vertebrates is symmetrically dimethylated (me2s). This R1810me2s modification requires protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) and recruits the Tudor domain of the survival of motor neuron (SMN, also known as GEMIN1) protein, which is mutated in spinal muscular atrophy. SMN interacts with senataxin, which is sometimes mutated in ataxia oculomotor apraxia type 2 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Because POLR2A R1810me2s and SMN, like senataxin, are required for resolving RNA–DNA hybrids created by RNA polymerase II that form R-loops in transcription termination regions, we propose that R1810me2s, SMN, and senataxin are components of an R-loop resolution pathway. Defects in this pathway can influence transcription termination and may contribute to neurodegenerative disorders. Symmetric dimethylation of the human RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain residue R1810 by the protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) directly recruits the protein survival of motor neuron (SMN) and indirectly recruits the helicase senataxin to resolve R-loops and promote transcription termination. The repeating sequence of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II is a favoured target of many modification enzymes. In this study, Jack Greenblatt and colleagues identify and characterize a symmetrical dimethylation modification of an arginine residue, R1810, in the the C-terminal domain. The R1810me2s modification is made by PRMT5, which interacts with SMN (survival of motor neuron) protein, and indirectly with senataxin proteins; mutations in each of these proteins are found in neurodegenerative diseases. The authors propose that the R1810me2s modification of RNA Pol II, together with the activity of SMN and senataxin, is part of a pathway for resolution of transcription-associated R-loops that, if absent, affects gene expression by disrupting transcription termination.",

Mike Sleutel and colleagues performed cryo-transmission electron microscopy to investigate the birth, or nucleation, of protein crystals and their growth into two different crystalline structures and one disordered gel state. The two crystal polymorphs displayed unique nucleation pathways with their own building blocks for nucleus formation. The prismatic polymorph and the gel state shared the same fibrous precursor, and a fragment of the gel grew into new prismatic crystals. The authors analysed the intermolecular mode of binding and found that polymorphs could be selected by tuning the relative strengths of anisotropic versus isotropic attraction between the monomers. This enabled them to knock out specific polymorph growth via site-directed mutagenesis to tune the strength of attraction at specific contact sites. The authors hope that these insights could lead to new polymorph selection strategies of interest in medicine, structural biology and protein-based drug-delivery applications. The formation of condensed (compacted) protein phases is associated with a wide range of human disorders, such as eye cataracts1, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis2, sickle cell anaemia3 and Alzheimer’s disease4. However, condensed protein phases have their uses: as crystals, they are harnessed by structural biologists to elucidate protein structures5, or are used as delivery vehicles for pharmaceutical applications6. The physiochemical properties of crystals can vary substantially between different forms or structures (‘polymorphs’) of the same macromolecule, and dictate their usability in a scientific or industrial context. To gain control over an emerging polymorph, one needs a molecular-level understanding of the pathways that lead to the various macroscopic states and of the mechanisms that govern pathway selection. However, it is still not clear how the embryonic seeds of a macromolecular phase are formed, or how these nuclei affect polymorph selection. Here we use time-resolved cryo-transmission electron microscopy to image the nucleation of crystals of the protein glucose isomerase, and to uncover at molecular resolution the nucleation pathways that lead to two crystalline states and one gelled state. We show that polymorph selection takes place at the earliest stages of structure formation and is based on specific building blocks for each space group. Moreover, we demonstrate control over the system by selectively forming desired polymorphs through site-directed mutagenesis, specifically tuning intermolecular bonding or gel seeding. Our results differ from the present picture of protein nucleation7,8,9,10,11,12, in that we do not identify a metastable dense liquid as the precursor to the crystalline state. Rather, we observe nucleation events that are driven by oriented attachments between subcritical clusters that already exhibit a degree of crystallinity. These insights suggest ways of controlling macromolecular phase transitions, aiding the development of protein-based drug-delivery systems and macromolecular crystallography.",

		"desc": "New anomalocaridid specimens from the Early Ordovician Fezouata Biota of Morocco show well-preserved trunk anatomy, revealing evidence for the evolution of arthropod limbs. The classic 'Burgess Shales' variety of Cambrian fauna is now known to extend into the Ordovician that begins around 490 million years ago. The anomalocaridids, a diverse group of arthropod-like animals, are familiar as the giant predators of the Cambrian seas. Here Peter Van Roy et al. describe a much younger anomalocaridid from the Ordovician of Morocco, which was a filter-feeder more than two metres long. The new fossils reveal evolutionary relationships with arthropod limbs, in the form of two pairs of swimming flaps on each division of the trunk, the lower pair representing a modified leg and the upper pair representing gills. Exceptionally preserved fossils from the Palaeozoic era provide crucial insights into arthropod evolution, with recent discoveries bringing phylogeny and character homology into sharp focus1,2,3,4. Integral to such studies are anomalocaridids, a clade of stem arthropods whose remarkable morphology illuminates early arthropod relationships5,6 and Cambrian ecology7,8,9. Although recent work has focused on the anomalocaridid head6,7,8,9,10, the nature of their trunk has been debated widely5,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18. Here we describe new anomalocaridid17 specimens from the Early Ordovician Fezouata Biota of Morocco19, which not only show well-preserved head appendages providing key ecological data, but also elucidate the nature of anomalocaridid trunk flaps, resolving their homology with arthropod trunk limbs. The new material shows that each trunk segment bears a separate dorsal and ventral pair of flaps, with a series of setal blades attached at the base of the dorsal flaps. Comparisons with other stem lineage arthropods16,20,21,22 indicate that anomalocaridid ventral flaps are homologous with lobopodous walking limbs and the endopod of the euarthropod biramous limb, whereas the dorsal flaps and associated setal blades are homologous with the flaps of gilled lobopodians (for example, Kerygmachela kierkegaardi, Pambdelurion whittingtoni) and exites of the ‘Cambrian biramous limb’23. This evidence shows that anomalocaridids represent a stage before the fusion of exite and endopod into the ‘Cambrian biramous limb’5,16,23, confirming their basal placement in the euarthropod stem4,5,6, rather than in the arthropod crown24 or with cycloneuralian worms14. Unlike other anomalocaridids, the Fezouata taxon combines head appendages convergently9 adapted for filter-feeding with an unprecedented body length exceeding 2 m, indicating a new direction in the feeding ecology of the clade. The evolution of giant filter-feeding anomalocaridids may reflect the establishment of highly developed planktic ecosystems during the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event25.",

During the Mesozoic era (around 250 million to 65 million years ago), body sizes reached extremes; nevertheless, the largest known egg belongs to the only recently extinct elephant bird3, which was roughly 66 million years younger than the last nonavian dinosaurs and giant marine reptiles. Here we report a new type of egg discovered in nearshore marine deposits from the Late Cretaceous period (roughly 68 million years ago) of Antarctica. It exceeds all nonavian dinosaur eggs in volume and differs from them in structure. Although the elephant bird egg is slightly larger, its eggshell is roughly five times thicker and shows a substantial prismatic layer and complex pore structure4. By contrast, the new fossil, visibly collapsed and folded, presents a thin eggshell with a layered structure that lacks a prismatic layer and distinct pores, and is similar to that of most extant lizards and snakes (Lepidosauria)5. The identity of the animal that laid the egg is unknown, but these preserved morphologies are consistent with the skeletal remains of mosasaurs (large marine lepidosaurs) found nearby. They are not consistent with described morphologies of dinosaur eggs of a similar size class. Phylogenetic analyses of traits for 259 lepidosaur species plus outgroups suggest that the egg belonged to an individual that was at least 7 metres long, hypothesized to be a giant marine reptile, all clades of which have previously been proposed to show live birth6. Such a large egg with a relatively thin eggshell may reflect derived constraints associated with body shape, reproductive investment linked with gigantism, and lepidosaurian viviparity, in which a ‘vestigial’ egg is laid and hatches immediately7. A fossil egg unearthed from Cretaceous deposits in Antarctica is more than 20 cm long, exceeds all known nonavian eggs in volume, is soft-shelled, and was perhaps laid by a giant marine lizard such as a mosasaur.",

All current models of the molecular circadian clockwork in eukaryotic cells are based on transcription–translation feedback loops. Non-transcriptional mechanisms in the clockwork have been difficult to study in mammalian systems. We circumvented these problems by developing novel assays using human red blood cells, which have no nucleus (or DNA) and therefore cannot perform transcription. Our results show that transcription is not required for circadian oscillations in humans, and that non-transcriptional events seem to be sufficient to sustain cellular circadian rhythms. Using red blood cells, we found that peroxiredoxins, highly conserved antioxidant proteins, undergo ∼24-hour redox cycles, which persist for many days under constant conditions (that is, in the absence of external cues). Moreover, these rhythms are entrainable (that is, tunable by environmental stimuli) and temperature-compensated, both key features of circadian rhythms. We anticipate that our findings will facilitate more sophisticated cellular clock models, highlighting the interdependency of transcriptional and non-transcriptional oscillations in potentially all eukaryotic cells. Circadian clocks are critical timing regulators of physiology and behaviour that are ubiquitous in eukaryotes. Most mechanistic models of the clock are based on transcription cycles, but evidence for post-translational regulation has recently surfaced in plants and cyanobacteria. Two groups now demonstrate a role for the oxidation of peroxiredoxin proteins in maintaining an entrainable oscillation in human red blood cells and in the unicellular alga Ostreococcus tauri. These data suggest a role for non-transcriptional mechanisms in clock models and open the door to future work exploring the connections between the transcriptional and non-transcriptional circadian machinery.

The most ancient phylogenetic divergences among crown birds are known to have occurred in the Cretaceous period1–3, but stem-lineage representatives of the deepest subclades of crown birds—Palaeognathae (ostriches and kin), Galloanserae (landfowl and waterfowl) and Neoaves (all other extant birds)—are unknown from the Mesozoic era. As a result, key questions related to the ecology4,5, biogeography3,6,7 and divergence times1,8–10 of ancestral crown birds remain unanswered. Here we report a new Mesozoic fossil that occupies a position close to the last common ancestor of Galloanserae and fills a key phylogenetic gap in the early evolutionary history of crown birds10,11. Asteriornis maastrichtensis, gen. et sp. nov., from the Maastrichtian age of Belgium (66.8–66.7 million years ago), is represented by a nearly complete, three-dimensionally preserved skull and associated postcranial elements. The fossil represents one of the only well-supported crown birds from the Mesozoic era12, and is the first Mesozoic crown bird with well-represented cranial remains. Asteriornis maastrichtensis exhibits a previously undocumented combination of galliform (landfowl)-like and anseriform (waterfowl)-like features, and its presence alongside a previously reported Ichthyornis-like taxon from the same locality13 provides direct evidence of the co-occurrence of crown birds and avialan stem birds. Its occurrence in the Northern Hemisphere challenges biogeographical hypotheses of a Gondwanan origin of crown birds3, and its relatively small size and possible littoral ecology may corroborate proposed ecological filters4,5,9 that influenced the persistence of crown birds through the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. A newly discovered fossil from the Cretaceous of Belgium is the oldest modern bird ever found, showing a unique combination of features and suggesting attributes shared by avian survivors of the end-Cretaceous extinction.",

Andrea Cau and colleagues describe Halszkaraptor, a small theropod with a number of unusual, potentially amphibious features. Synchrotron scanning reveals a domed head, a long, swan-like neck, a beak-like snout and several other adaptations that suggest that it spent at least some time in the water. The researchers group the finding with two other hitherto enigmatic and fragmentary finds to produce a new dinosaur subfamily, the Halszkaraptorinae. This adds another string to the versatile bow of maniraptoran theropods, which comprise a wide range of highly diverse forms, including birds. Maniraptora includes birds and their closest relatives among theropod dinosaurs1,2,3,4,5. During the Cretaceous period, several maniraptoran lineages diverged from the ancestral coelurosaurian bauplan and evolved novel ecomorphologies, including active flight2, gigantism3, cursoriality4 and herbivory5. Propagation X-ray phase-contrast synchrotron microtomography of a well-preserved maniraptoran from Mongolia, still partially embedded in the rock matrix, revealed a mosaic of features, most of them absent among non-avian maniraptorans but shared by reptilian and avian groups with aquatic or semiaquatic ecologies6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. This new theropod, Halszkaraptor escuilliei gen. et sp. nov., is related to other enigmatic Late Cretaceous maniraptorans from Mongolia15,16 in a novel clade at the root of Dromaeosauridae17. This lineage adds an amphibious ecomorphology to those evolved by maniraptorans: it acquired a predatory mode that relied mainly on neck hyperelongation for food procurement, it coupled the obligatory bipedalism of theropods with forelimb proportions that may support a swimming function, and it developed postural adaptations convergent with short-tailed birds.",

		"desc": "Changes in disturbance regimes due to climate change are increasingly challenging the capacity of ecosystems to absorb recurrent shocks and reassemble afterwards, escalating the risk of widespread ecological collapse of current ecosystems and the emergence of novel assemblages1–3. In marine systems, the production of larvae and recruitment of functionally important species are fundamental processes for rebuilding depleted adult populations, maintaining resilience and avoiding regime shifts in the face of rising environmental pressures4,5. Here we document a regional-scale shift in stock–recruitment relationships of corals along the Great Barrier Reef—the world’s largest coral reef system—following unprecedented back-to-back mass bleaching events caused by global warming. As a consequence of mass mortality of adult brood stock in 2016 and 2017 owing to heat stress6, the amount of larval recruitment declined in 2018 by 89% compared to historical levels. For the first time, brooding pocilloporids replaced spawning acroporids as the dominant taxon in the depleted recruitment pool. The collapse in stock–recruitment relationships indicates that the low resistance of adult brood stocks to repeated episodes of coral bleaching is inexorably tied to an impaired capacity for recovery, which highlights the multifaceted processes that underlie the global decline of coral reefs. The extent to which the Great Barrier Reef will be able to recover from the collapse in stock–recruitment relationships remains uncertain, given the projected increased frequency of extreme climate events over the next two decades7. A regional-scale shift in the relationships between adult stock and recruitment of corals occurred along the Great Barrier Reef, following mass bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 caused by global warming.",

In terms of our data processing, we were aware from the outset of the problems of unevenly spaced temporal data and sediment dating errors. We also wanted to duplicate, as far as possible, the methods published previously that had been used to identify early warning signals in palaeoenvironmental data (for example, ref. 3). Thus, we applied two standard smoothing functions (exponential and Gaussian kernel) to interpolated and non-interpolated (original) diatom data, expressed as three statistical indices (detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), Hill’s diversity index N2 (HDI) and correspondence analysis), using different sliding-window sizes and the two-standard-deviation range of dates for each sample.",

		"title": "Biodiversity effects in the wild are common and as strong as key drivers of productivity",
		"desc": "A synthesis of 67 biodiversity studies shows that, after controlling for environmental covariates, the effects of biodiversity on biomass are stronger in nature than in experiments and are comparable to the effects of other drivers of productivity. Biodiversity enhances ecosystem productivity and stability in experimental studies, but whether this relationship holds in real-world ecosystems under natural conditions is unclear. In this meta-analysis, Emmett Duffy et al. show that biodiversity bolsters productivity across a range of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and taxa. The beneficial effects of biodiversity on biomass proved stronger than those seen in experimental settings, and were comparable to, or larger in magnitude than, those of other well-known drivers of productivity. The findings confirm the importance of biodiversity in sustaining the productivity of ecosystems around the world, and the authors call for an integration of this understanding into global change policy. More than 500 controlled experiments have collectively suggested that biodiversity loss reduces ecosystem productivity and stability1,2,3. Yet the importance of biodiversity in sustaining the world’s ecosystems remains controversial4,5,6,7,8, largely because of the lack of validation in nature, where strong abiotic forcing and complex interactions are assumed to swamp biodiversity effects6,7,8,9. Here we test this assumption by analysing 133 estimates reported in 67 field studies that statistically separated the effects of biodiversity on biomass production from those of abiotic forcing. Contrary to the prevailing opinion of the previous two decades that biodiversity would have rare or weak effects in nature, we show that biomass production increases with species richness in a wide range of wild taxa and ecosystems. In fact, after controlling for environmental covariates, increases in biomass with biodiversity are stronger in nature than has previously been documented in experiments and comparable to or stronger than the effects of other well-known drivers of productivity, including climate and nutrient availability. These results are consistent with the collective experimental evidence that species richness increases community biomass production, and suggest that the role of biodiversity in maintaining productive ecosystems should figure prominently in global change science and policy.",

		"desc": "Electronegativity is a key property of the elements. Being useful in rationalizing stability, structure and properties of molecules and solids, it has shaped much of the thinking in the fields of structural chemistry and solid state chemistry and physics. There are many definitions of electronegativity, which can be roughly classified as either spectroscopic (these are defined for isolated atoms) or thermochemical (characterizing bond energies and heats of formation of compounds). The most widely used is the thermochemical Pauling’s scale, where electronegativities have units of eV1/2. Here we identify drawbacks in the definition of Pauling’s electronegativity scale—and, correcting them, arrive at our thermochemical scale, where electronegativities are dimensionless numbers. Our scale displays intuitively correct trends for the 118 elements and leads to an improved description of chemical bonding (e.g., bond polarity) and thermochemistry. Pauling’s electronegativity scale has a fundamental value and uses accessible thermochemical data, but fails at predicting the bonding behavior for several elements. The authors propose their thermochemical scale based on experimental dissociation energies that provides dimensionless values for the electronegativity and recovers the correct trends throughout the periodic table.",

		"desc": "The Altai region of Siberia was inhabited for parts of the Pleistocene by at least two groups of archaic hominins—Denisovans and Neanderthals. Denisova Cave, uniquely, contains stratified deposits that preserve skeletal and genetic evidence of both hominins, artefacts made from stone and other materials, and a range of animal and plant remains. The previous site chronology is based largely on radiocarbon ages for fragments of bone and charcoal that are up to 50,000 years old; older ages of equivocal reliability have been estimated from thermoluminescence and palaeomagnetic analyses of sediments, and genetic analyses of hominin DNA. Here we describe the stratigraphic sequences in Denisova Cave, establish a chronology for the Pleistocene deposits and associated remains from optical dating of the cave sediments, and reconstruct the environmental context of hominin occupation of the site from around 300,000 to 20,000 years ago. Optical dating of sediments from Denisova Cave establishes a chronology for its Pleistocene deposits and the associated artefacts, hominin remains and environmental records, which date to between about 300,000 and 20,000 years ago.",

		"title": "Synthesis of macrocyclic natural products by catalyst-controlled stereoselective ring-closing metathesis",
		"desc": "There are a large number of chemical transformations in which alkenes act as the reactants and/or products of the reaction. Perhaps the most widely utilized approach to synthesis of unsaturated large rings is catalytic ring-closing metathesis (RCM), but this reaction often proceeds with little control over alkene. Amir Hoveyda and colleagues have developed a method for highly efficient and stereoselective synthesis of macrocyclic alkenes by catalytic RCM. It involves catalytic Z-isomer-selective cross-metathesis reactions of terminal enol ethers, which have not been reported previously, and allylic amides, used previously only in E-isomer-selective processes. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by the stereoselective synthesis of anticancer agents epothilone C and nakadomarin A. Many natural products contain a C = C double bond through which various other derivatives can be prepared; the stereochemical identity of the alkene can be critical to the biological activities of such molecules. Catalytic ring-closing metathesis (RCM) is a widely used method for the synthesis of large unsaturated rings1,2; however, cyclizations often proceed without control of alkene stereochemistry2. This shortcoming is particularly costly when the cyclization reaction is performed after a long sequence of other chemical transformations2. Here we outline a reliable, practical and general approach for the efficient and highly stereoselective synthesis of macrocyclic alkenes by catalytic RCM; transformations deliver up to 97% of the Z isomer owing to control induced by a tungsten-based alkylidene. Utility is demonstrated through the stereoselective preparation of epothilone C (refs 3–5) and nakadomarin A (ref. 6), the previously reported syntheses of which have been marred by late-stage, non-selective RCM7,8,9,10,11,12. The tungsten alkylidene can be manipulated in air, delivering the products in useful yields with high stereoselectivity. As a result of efficient RCM and re-incorporation of side products into the catalytic cycle with minimal alkene isomerization, desired cyclizations proceed in preference to alternative pathways, even under relatively high substrate concentration.",

		"desc": "EZH2 is a methyltransferase that is mutated in lymphoma; here a potent small molecule inhibitor of EZH2 is described, which inhibits the proliferation of EZH2 mutant cell lines and growth of EZH2 mutant xenografts in mice, thus providing a potential treatment for EZH2 mutant lymphoma. EZH2, the catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is involved in repressing gene expression through methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27). Overexpression of EZH2 is implicated in tumorigenesis, and mutations within its catalytic domain occur in lymphoma. Here, Caretha Creasy and colleagues describe a potent small-molecule inhibitor of EZH2 methyltransferase activity that decreases levels of methylated H3K27 and reactivates silenced PRC2 target genes. It also inhibits the proliferation of EZH2 mutant cell lines and the growth of EZH2 mutant xenografts in mice. Pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 activity may therefore be a viable strategy for treating EZH2 mutant lymphoma. In eukaryotes, post-translational modification of histones is critical for regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. EZH2 is the catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and is involved in repressing gene expression through methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27). EZH2 overexpression is implicated in tumorigenesis and correlates with poor prognosis in several tumour types1,2,3,4,5. Additionally, somatic heterozygous mutations of Y641 and A677 residues within the catalytic SET domain of EZH2 occur in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma6,7,8,9,10. The Y641 residue is the most frequently mutated residue, with up to 22% of germinal centre B-cell DLBCL and follicular lymphoma harbouring mutations at this site. These lymphomas have increased H3K27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) owing to altered substrate preferences of the mutant enzymes9,11,12,13. However, it is unknown whether specific, direct inhibition of EZH2 methyltransferase activity will be effective in treating EZH2 mutant lymphomas. Here we demonstrate that GSK126, a potent, highly selective, S-adenosyl-methionine-competitive, small-molecule inhibitor of EZH2 methyltransferase activity, decreases global H3K27me3 levels and reactivates silenced PRC2 target genes. GSK126 effectively inhibits the proliferation of EZH2 mutant DLBCL cell lines and markedly inhibits the growth of EZH2 mutant DLBCL xenografts in mice. Together, these data demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 activity may provide a promising treatment for EZH2 mutant lymphoma.",
