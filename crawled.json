Aside from bonds to organyl fragments or molecules, bonds to 'inorganic' carbon, like carbon monoxide, cyanide, or carbide, are generally considered to be organometallic as well. Some related compounds such as transition metal hydrides and metal phosphine complexes are often included in discussions of organometallic compounds, though strictly speaking, they are not necessarily organometallic. The related but distinct term \"metalorganic compound\" refers to metal-containing compounds lacking direct metal-carbon bonds but which contain organic ligands. Metal β-diketonates, alkoxides, dialkylamides, and metal phosphine complexes are representative members of this class.

This became the model for the composition of all future Parliaments. Over the course of the next century, the membership of Parliament was divided into the two houses it features today, with the noblemen and bishops encompassing the House of Lords and the knights of the shire and local representatives making up the House of Commons. During Henry IV's time on the throne, the role of Parliament expanded beyond the determination of taxation policy to include the \"redress of grievances,\" which essentially enabled English citizens to petition the body to address complaints in their local towns and counties.

A region where this process occurs is known as a subduction zone, and its surface expression is known as an arc-trench complex.

A notable example is the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. Such eruptions result when sufficient gas has dissolved under pressure within a viscous magma such that expelled lava violently froths into volcanic ash when pressure is suddenly lowered at the vent. Sometimes a lava plug will block the conduit to the summit, and when this occurs, eruptions are more violent. Explosive eruptions can send rocks, dust, gas and pyroclastic material up to 20 km (12 mi) into the atmosphere at a rate of up to 100,000 tonnes per second, traveling at several hundred meters per second.

Offshore volcanoes form islands, resulting in a volcanic island arc. Generally, volcanic arcs result from the subduction of an oceanic tectonic plate under another tectonic plate, and often parallel an oceanic trench. The oceanic plate is saturated with water, and volatiles such as water drastically lower the melting point of the mantle. As the oceanic plate is subducted, it is subjected to greater and greater pressures with increasing depth. This pressure squeezes water out of the plate and introduces it to the mantle. Here the mantle melts and forms magma at depth under the overriding plate. The magma ascends to form an arc of volcanoes parallel to the subduction zone.","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_arc"},{"id":1142,"title":"Stratovolcano","desc":"A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a conical volcano built up by many layers (strata) of hardened lava and tephra. Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile with a summit crater and periodic intervals of explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions, although some have collapsed summit craters called calderas. The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far, due to high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, having high-to-intermediate levels of silica, with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma. Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as 15 km (9.3 mi).","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratovolcano"},{"id":1143,"title":"Lava dome","desc":"In volcanology, a lava dome is a circular mound-shaped protrusion resulting from the slow extrusion of viscous lava from a volcano. Dome-building eruptions are common, particularly in convergent plate boundary settings. Around 6% of eruptions on Earth are lava dome forming. The geochemistry of lava domes can vary from basalt to rhyolite although the majority are of intermediate composition The characteristic dome shape is attributed to high viscosity that prevents the lava from flowing very far. This high viscosity can be obtained in two ways: by high levels of silica in the magma, or by degassing of fluid magma. Since viscous basaltic and andesitic domes weather fast and easily break apart by further input of fluid lava, most of the preserved domes have high silica content and consist of rhyolite or dacite.","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava_dome"},{"id":1144,"title":"Volcanological Survey of Indonesia","desc":"Volcanological Survey of Indonesia is the official Indonesian government agency under Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources which are responsible for investigating, recording, and warning about volcanoes within the Indonesian region of responsibility and geological hazard mitigation.","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanological_Survey_of_Indonesia"},{"id":1145,"title":"Banda Arc","desc":"The Banda Arc is a set of island arcs in eastern Indonesia.

A volcanic crater can be of large dimensions, and sometimes of great depth. During certain types of explosive eruptions, a volcano's magma chamber may empty enough for an area above it to subside, forming a type of larger depression known as a caldera.","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_crater"},{"id":1151,"title":"Portal:Indonesia","desc":"Portal:Indonesia","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Indonesia"},{"id":1152,"title":"Karo Regency","desc":"Karo Regency is a landlocked regency of North Sumatra, Indonesia, situated in the Barisan Mountains.

Many old lava flows are on its flanks and the last known eruption, before recent times, occurred 1200 years before present, between 740 - 880 CE. Solfataric activities were last observed at the summit in 1912; recent documented events include an eruption in the early hours of 29 August 2010 and eruptions in September and November 2013, January, February and October 2014. The volcano has recently claimed the life of at least 23 people in a number of events since 2014. Between 2013 and 2014, the alert for a major event was increased with no significant activity. On 2 June 2015, the alert was again increased, and on 26 June 2015, at least 10,000 people were evacuated, fearing a major eruption. The long eruption of Mount Sinabung is similar to that of Mount Unzen in Japan, which erupted for five years after lying dormant for 400 years. A major eruption began on 10 August 2020.","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Mount_Sinabung"},{"id":1348,"title":"Daftar 2 Tim yang Lolos ke 16 Besar Liga Champions:  Ajax dan Liverpool Berpotensi Menyusul","desc":"Match day 4 Liga Champions grup E hingga F telah selesai.","link":"https://m.liputan6.com/cek-fakta"},{"id":1349,"title":"Business","desc":"Find the latest business news with reports on Wall Street, interest rates, banking, companies, and U.S. and world financial markets.
